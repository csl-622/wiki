Food:
Where Does It Come From?

W

hat did you eat at home
today? Find out what your
friend ate today. Did you eat
the same kind of food yesterday and
today? We all eat different kinds of food
at different times, isn’t it?

1.1 FOOD VARIETY
Activity 1
Ask your friends in the school about the
items they would be eating during a day.
See if you can also get this information
from friends staying in different states
of India. List all the items in your
notebook as given in Table 1.1, for as
many friends as possible.
Table 1.1 What do we eat?
Name of the
student/friend

Food items
eaten in a day

There seems to be so much variety
in the food that we eat. What are these
food items made of?
Think about rice
cooked at home. We take
raw rice and boil it in
water. Just two materials
or ingredients are needed to prepare a
dish of boiled rice.
On the other hand, some food items
are made with many ingredients. To
prepare vegetable curry, we need
different kinds of vegetables, salt, spices,
oil and so on.

Activity 2
Choose some of the items you listed in
Table 1.1 and try to find out what
ingredients are used to prepare these,
by discussing with your friends and
elders at home. List them in Table 1.2.
Some examples are given here. Add
some more items to this list.
Table 1.2 Food items and their
ingredients

Pulses, water, salt, oil/
ghee, spices

What do we find? Do we find some ingredients common
for different food items? Discuss in class.
So, where do these ingredients come from?

1.2 FOOD MATERIALS AND SOURCES
It may be easy for us to guess the sources of some of the
ingredients that we listed in Table 1.2. Fruits and
vegetables, for instance. Where do they come from? Plants,
of course! What are the sources of rice or wheat? You may
have seen paddy or wheat fields with rows and rows of
plants, which give us these grains.
And then, there are food items like milk, eggs, meat,
chicken, fish, prawns, beef, pork and such others, which
come from animals.

Activity 3
Let us take the food items listed earlier
and try to find out where they come from
— the ingredients and their sources.
Some examples are shown in Table 1.3.
Fill in the blanks in Table 1.3 and add
more examples to this list.

What do we conclude from Activity
3? Plants are the sources of food
ingredients like grains, cereals,
vegetables and fruits. Animals provide
us with milk, meat products and eggs.
Cows, goats and buffaloes are some
common animals which give us milk.
Milk and milk products like butter,
cream, cheese and curd are used all over
the world. Can you name some other
animals which give us milk?

1.3 PLANT PARTS AND ANIMAL
PRODUCTS AS FOOD
Plants are one source of our food. Which
parts of a plant are these?
We eat many leafy vegetables. We eat
fruits of some plants. Sometimes roots,
sometimes stems and even flowers. Have

you ever eaten Flower
pumpkin flowers
dipped in rice
paste and fried?
Bud
Try it!
Stem
Some plants
Leaf
have two or more
edible (eatable)
parts. Seeds of

Roots
give us oil and
the leaves are
used
as
a
vegetable. Can
you think of the
different parts of a banana plant that
are used as food? Think of more
examples where many parts of a single
plant are used as food.

Activity 4
Paheli wants to know if any of our
food comes from sources other
than plants and animals.

From all the food items you have listed
in Table 1.3, choose those items whose
ingredients are obtained from plants.
Which part of a plant? Identify these
and list the food items and plant parts
as shown in Table 1.4.

Do not try to test unknown plants
around you to see if they are edible!
Some plants could be poisonous.

Activity 5
Take some dry seeds of moong or chana.
Put a small quantity of seeds in a
container filled with water and leave this
aside for a day. Next day, drain the water
completely and leave the seeds in the
vessel. Wrap them with a piece of wet
cloth and set aside. The following day,
do you observe any changes in the seed?

Do you know where honey comes
from, or how it is produced? Have you
seen a beehive where so many bees keep
buzzing about?
Bees collect nectar
(sweet juices) from
flowers, convert it
into honey and
store it in their
hive. Flowers and
their nectar may be
available only for a
part of the year. So,
bees store this
nectar for their use
all through the
year. When we find
such a beehive, we collect the food stored
by the bees as honey.

1.5 WHAT
A small white structure may have grown
out of the seeds. If so, the seeds have
sprouted. If not, wash the seeds in water,
drain the water and leave them aside
for another day, covered with a wet cloth.
The next day, see if the seeds have
sprouted.
After washing these sprouted seeds,
you can eat them. They can also be
boiled. Add some spices and get a tasty
snack to eat.

DO

ANIMALS EAT?

Do you have cattle or a pet that you
take care of? A dog, cat, buffalo or a
goat? You will then surely be aware of
the food, the animal eats. What about
other animals? Have you ever observed
what a squirrel, pigeon, lizard or a small
insect may be eating as their food?

Activity 6
Several animals are listed in Table 1.5.
For some of them, the type of food they

plant products in Group 1. These are
called herbivores. There are some
animals which eat other animals.
Place these in Group 2. These animals
are called carnivores. Do you find
some animals which eat both plants
and animals? Place them in Group 3.
These are called omnivores. Prepare
a table as in Table 1.6 and enter
these separately in the three columns,
as shown.

FOOD: WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?

We know that there are many
amongst us, who do not get sufficient
food. We need to find ways by which
more food can be grown in the country.
That will not be enough; we will need to
find ways to ensure that this food is
made easily available to each and every
one of us.

SUGGESTED PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES
1.

You must have seen a garden lizard around your home. Next time whenever you see it, observe carefully and find out what it takes for food. Is the
food different from that of a house lizard?

2.

Make a list (with pictures, when possible) of food items generally taken by
people of different regions of India. Place these on a large outline map of
India to display in your classroom.

3.

Find out the names of plants that grow in water and which are eaten
as food.

4.

In Chapter 10, you will find out ways of measuring length of curved lines.
In your mathematics classes you will learn to prepare bar graphs. After
you learn these, try the following interesting project. Prepare some sprouts
of moong as discussed in the chapter. Wash them in water everyday and
drain all the water. Let them grow for a week until the whole of the seeds
grow into young plants. Measure the lengths of the sprouts everyday using
a string. Take care that they do not break. Prepare a bar graph of the
number of sprouts having lengths in different ranges.

THINGS TO THINK ABOUT
1.

Does everyone around you get enough food to eat? If not, why?

2.

What are the ways we can think of to avoid wastage of food?

Components of Food

n Chapter 1, we made lists of the
food items that we eat. We also
identified food items eaten in
different parts of India and marked
these on its map.
A meal could consist of chapati, dal
and brinjal curry. Another may be rice,
sambar and a vegetable preparation of
lady’s finger (bhindi). Yet another meal
could be appam, fish curry and
vegetables.

I

curd, butter milk and pickles. Some
examples of meals from different regions
are given in Table 2.1. Select food items
you depicted on the map in Chapter 1.
Add some more meals to this list and
enter these in Table 2.1.
Sometimes, we may not really have
all this variety in our meals. If we are
travelling, we may eat whatever is
available on the way. It may not be
possible for some of us, to eat such a
variety of items, most of the time.
There must be some reason though,
why meals usually consist of such a
distribution. Do you think that our body
needs different kinds of food for some
special purpose?

Activity 1

2.1 WHAT DO DIFFERENT FOOD
ITEMS CONTAIN?

Our meals usually have at least one item
made of some kind of grain. Other items
could be a dal or a dish of meat and
vegetables. It may also include items like

We know that each dish is usually made
up of one or more ingredients, which
we get from plants or animals. These

ingredients contain some components
that are needed by our body. These
components are called nutrients. The
major nutrients in our food are named
carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins
and minerals. In addition, food contains
dietary fibres and water which are also
needed by our body.
Do all foods contain all these
nutrients? With some simple methods
we can test whether cooked food or a
raw ingredient contains one or more of
these nutrients. The tests for presence
of carbohydrates, proteins and fats
are simpler to do as compared to the
tests for other nutrients. Let us do these
tests and record all our observations
in Table 2.2.
For carrying out these tests, you will
need solutions of iodine, copper
sulphate and caustic soda. You will also
need a few test tubes and a dropper.
Try these tests on cooked food items
as well as raw materials. Table 2.2 shows
you a way to record the observations
from these tests. Some food items are
given in this table. You can conduct the
tests either with these or any other
available food items. Do these tests
carefully and do not try to eat or taste
any chemicals.
If the required solutions are not
available in readymade form, your
teacher can prepare them as follows.
Let us begin by testing different
food items to see if they contain
carbohydrates. There are many
types of carbohydrates. The main
carbohydrates found in our food are in

A dilute solution of iodine can be
prepared by adding a few drops of
tincture iodine to a test tube half filled

Copper sulphate solution can be

the form of starch and sugars. We can
easily test if a food item contains starch.

Activity 2
Test for Starch
Take a small quantity of a food item or
a raw ingredient. Put 2-3 drops of dilute
iodine solution on it (Fig. 2.1). Observe
if there is any change in the colour of
the food item. Did it turn blue-black?

contains starch.
Repeat this test with other food items

the test tube stand for a few minutes.
What do you see? Did the contents of
the test tube turn violet? A violet colour
indicates presence of proteins in the
food item.
Now, you can repeat this test on other
food items.

Take a small quantity of a food item for
testing. If the food you want to

SCIENCE

Test for Fats
Take a small quantity of a food item.
Wrap it in a piece of paper and crush it.
Take care that the paper does not tear.
Now, straighten the paper and observe
it carefully. Does it have an oily patch?
Hold the paper against light. Are you
able to see the light faintly, through
this patch?
An oily patch on paper shows that
the food item contains fat. The food
items may sometimes contain a little
water. Therefore, after you have rubbed
an item on paper, let the paper dry for a
while. If there were any water that may
have come from food, it would dry up
after some time. If no oily patch shows
up after this, the food item does not
contain any fat.
What do these tests show? Are fats,
proteins and starch present in all the
food items that you tested? Does a food
item contain more than one nutrient?
Do you find any food item that does not
contain any of these nutrients?
We tested food items for three
nutrients — carbohydrates, proteins
and fats. There are also other nutrients
like vitamins and minerals that are
present in different food items. Why do
we need all these nutrients?

Vitamins help in protecting our body
against diseases. Vitamins also help in
keeping our eyes, bones, teeth and gums
healthy.
Vitamins are of different kinds
known by different names. Some of these
are Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin D,
Vitamin E and K. There is also a group
of vitamins called Vitamin B-complex.
Our body needs all types of vitamins in

for proper growth of body and to
maintain good health. Some sources of
different minerals are shown in Fig. 2.10.
Most food items, usually, have more
than one nutrient. You may have noticed
this, while recording your observations
in Table 2.2. However, in a given raw
material, one particular nutrient may
be present in much larger quantity than
in others. For example, rice has more
carbohydrates than other nutrients.
Thus, we say that rice is a “carbohydrate
rich” source of food.
Besides these nutrients, our body
needs dietary fibres and water. Dietary
fibres are also known as roughage.
Roughage is mainly provided by plant
products in our foods. Whole grains and
pulses, potatoes, fresh fruits and
vegetables are main sources of roughage.
Roughage does not provide any nutrient
to our body, but is an essential
component of our food and adds to its
bulk. This helps our body get rid of
undigested food.

Water helps our body to absorb
nutrients from food. It also helps in
throwing out some wastes from body as
urine and sweat. Normally, we get most
of the water that our body needs from
the liquids we drink — such as water,
milk and tea. In addition, we add water
to most cooked foods. Let’s see if there
is any other source which provides water
to our body.

Activity 3
Take a tomato or a fruit like lemon. Cut
it into small pieces. Do your hands get
wet while doing so?
Carefully
observe
whenever
vegetables and fruits are being cut,
peeled, grated or mashed at your
home. Do you find any fresh vegetables
or fruits that do not contain some
amount of water?
We see that many food materials
themselves contain water. To some
extent, our body needs are met by this
water. Apart from this, we also add water
while cooking many food items.

2.3 BALANCED DIET
The food we normally eat in a day is our
diet. For growth and maintenance of
good health, our diet should have all
the nutrients that our body needs, in
right quantities. Not too much of one
and not too little of the other. The diet
should also contain a good amount of
roughage and water. Such a diet is called
a balanced diet.
Do you think that people of all ages
need the same type of diet? Do you also
14

think that, what we need for a balanced
diet would depend on the amount of
physical work that we do?
Prepare a chart of whatever you eat
over a period of a week. Check whether
all the nutrients mentioned are present
in one or the other food items being
eaten within a day or so.
Pulses, groundnut, soybean,
sprouted seeds (moong and Bengal
gram), fermented foods (South Indian
foods such as idlis), a combination of
flours (missi roti, thepla made from
cereals and pulses), banana, spinach,
sattu, jaggery, available vegetables and
other such foods provide many
nutrients. Therefore, one can eat a
balanced diet without expensive food
materials.
Eating the right kind of food is not
enough. It should also be cooked

Paheli wonders whether animal
food also consists of these
different components and do
they also need a balanced diet?

properly so that its nutrients are not
lost. Are you aware that some nutrients
get lost in the process of cooking and
preparations?
If the vegetables and fruits are
washed after cutting or peeling them, it
SCIENCE

may result in the loss of some vitamins.
The skins of many vegetables and fruits
contain vitamins and minerals.
Similarly, repeated washing of rice and
pulses may remove some vitamins and
minerals present in them.
We all know that cooking improves
the taste of food and makes it easier to
digest. At the same time, cooking also
results in the loss of certain nutrients.
Many useful proteins and considerable
amounts of minerals are lost if excess
water is used during cooking and is
then thrown away.
Vitamin C gets easily destroyed by
heat during cooking. Would it not be
sensible to include some fruits and raw
vegetables in our diet?
Boojho thought that fats would be
the best foods to eat, all the time. A katori
of fat will give much more energy than
a katori of carbohydrate rich food, isn’t
it? So, he ate nothing but food rich in

COMPONENTS OF FOOD

fats — fried food like samosa and poori,
malai, rabdi and peda.
Do you think he was right? No, of
course not! It can be very harmful for
us to eat too much of fat rich foods and
we may end up suffering from a
condition called obesity.

2.4 DEFICIENCY DISEASES
A person may be getting enough food to
eat, but sometimes the food may not
contain a particular nutrient. If this
continues over a long period of time, the
person may suffer from its deficiency.
Deficiency of one or more nutrients can
cause diseases or disorders in our body.
Diseases that occur due to lack of
nutrients over a long period are called
deficiency diseases.
If a person does not get enough
proteins in his/her food for a long time,
he/she is likely to have stunted growth,
swelling of face, discolouration of hair,
skin diseases and diarrhoea.
If the diet is deficient in both
carbohydrates and proteins for a long
period of time, the growth may stop
completely. Such a person becomes very
lean and thin and so weak that he/she
may not even be able to move.
Deficiency of different vitamins and
minerals may also result in certain
diseases or disorders. Some of these are
mentioned in Table 2.3.
All deficiency diseases can be
prevented by taking a balanced diet.
In this chapter, we asked ourselves
the reason why widely varying food from
different regions had a common

distribution. This distribution, we find, ensures that
our meals have a balance of the different nutrients
needed by the body.

The major nutrients in our food are carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins
and minerals. In addition, food also contains dietary fibres and water.
Carbohydrates and fats mainly provide energy to our body.
Proteins and minerals are needed for the growth and the maintenance
of our body.
Vitamins help in protecting our body against diseases.
Balanced diet provides all the nutrients that our body needs, in right
quantities, along with adequate amount of roughage and water.
Deficiency of one or more nutrients in our food for a long time may cause
certain diseases or disorders.

Prepare a diet chart to provide balance diet to a twelve year old child. The
diet chart should include food items which are not expensive and are commonly available in your area.

2.

We have learnt that excess intake of fats is harmful for the body. What about
other nutrients? Would it be harmful for the body to take too much of proteins
or vitamins in the diet? Read about diet related problems to find answers to
these questions and have a class discussion on this topic.

3.

Test the food usually eaten by cattle or a pet to find out which nutrients are

explained that some clothes or fabrics
were cotton and some were synthetic.
He also had woollen mufflers and
shawls. There were many silk sarees as
well. Paheli and Boojho felt very excited.
They touched and felt these different
fabrics. Finally, they bought a woollen
muffler and a cotton saree.
After their visit to the cloth shop,
Paheli and Boojho began to notice
various fabrics in their surroundings.
They found that bed sheets, blankets,

curtains, tablecloths, towels and
dusters were made from different kinds
of fabrics. Even their school bags and
the gunny bags were made from
some kind of fabric. They tried to
identify these fabrics as cotton, wool,
silk or synthetic. Can you also identify
some fabrics?

any fabric, it seems a continuous piece.
Now, look at it closely. What do you
notice (Fig. 3.2)?

Activity 2

Select a piece of cotton fabric you
labelled in Activity 1. Now, try to find a
loose thread or yarn at one of the edges
and pull it out (Fig. 3.3). If no loose

yarns are visible, you can gently pull
one out with a pin or a needle.
We find that a fabric is made up of
yarns arranged together. What are these
yarns made of?

Activity 3
Take out a yarn from a piece of cotton
fabric. Place this piece of yarn on the
table. Now, press one end of the yarn
with your thumb. Scratch the other end
of the yarn along its length with your
nail as shown in Fig. 3.4. Do you find
that at this end, the yarn splits up into
thin strands (Fig. 3.5)?

Fig.3.4 Splitting the yarn into thin strands

You might have observed something
similar when you try to thread a
needle. Many a time, the end of the
thread is separated into a few thin
strands. This makes it difficult to pass
the thread through the eye of the
needle. The thin strands of thread that
we see, are made up of still thinner
strands called fibres.
Fabrics are made up of yarns and
yarns are further made up of fibres.
Where do these fibres come from?
The fibres of some fabrics such as
cotton, jute, silk and wool are obtained
from plants and animals. These are
called natural fibres. Cotton and jute
are examples of fibres obtained from
plants. Wool and silk fibres are obtained
from animals. Wool is obtained from the
fleece of sheep or goat. It is also obtained
from the hair of rabbits, yak and
camels. Silk fibre is drawn from the
cocoon of silkworm.
For thousands of years natural fibres
were the only ones available for making
fabrics. In the last hundred years or so,
fibres are also made from chemical

museums, items like the
one shown here. These
were worn by warriors. He
wants to know if these
are made of some
kinds of fibre.

substances, which are not obtained
from plant or animal sources. These are
called synthetic fibres. Some examples
of synthetic fibres are polyester, nylon
and acrylic.

3.3 SOME PLANT FIBRES
Cotton
Have you ever made wicks for oil lamps?
What do you use for making these
wicks? This cotton wool is also used for
filling mattresses, quilts or pillows.
Take some cotton wool, pull it apart
and look at its edges. What do you
observe? The small, thin strands that
you see are made up of cotton fibres.
Where does this cotton wool come
from? It is grown in the fields. Cotton
plants are usually grown at places
having black soil and warm climate. Can
you name some states of our country
where cotton is grown? The fruits of the
cotton plant (cotton bolls) are about the
size of a lemon. After maturing, the bolls
burst open and the seeds covered with
cotton fibres can be seen. Have you ever

Fig.3.6 Field of cotton plants
20

seen a cotton field that is ready for
picking? It looks like a field covered with
snow (Fig.3.6).
From these bolls, cotton is usually
picked by hand. Fibres are then
separated from the seeds by combing.
This process is called ginning of cotton.
Ginning was traditionally done by hand
(Fig.3.7). These days, machines are also
used for ginning.

Fig. 3.7 Ginning of cotton

Jute
Jute fibre is obtained from the stem of
the jute plant (Fig 3.8). It is cultivated
during the rainy season. In India, jute is
mainly grown in
West Bengal, Bihar
and Assam. The
jute
plant
is
normally harvested
when it is at
flowering stage.
The stems of the
harvested plants
are immersed in
water for a few
days. The stems rot
and fibres are
separated by hand.

SCIENCE

Fig. 3.9 Making yarn from cotton

To make fabrics, all these fibres are
first converted into yarns. How is
it done?

3.4 SPINNING COTTON YARN
You can try making cotton yarn yourself.

Activity 4
Hold some cotton wool in one hand.
Pinch some cotton between the
thumb and forefinger of the
other hand. Now, gently start
pulling out the cotton, while
continuously twisting the
fibres (Fig. 3.9). Are you able
to make a yarn?
The process of making yarn
from fibres is called spinning.
In this process, fibres from a
mass of cotton wool are drawn
out and twisted. This brings
the fibres together to form
a yarn.
A simple device used
for spinning is a hand
spindle, also called takli
(Fig. 3.10). Another hand
operated device used for
spinning
is
charkha Fig. 3.10
(Fig. 3.11). Use of charkha was A Takli

popularised by Mahatma Gandhi as part
of the Independence movement. He
encouraged people to wear clothes made
of homespun yarn and shun imported
cloth made in the mills of Britain.
Spinning of yarn on a large scale is
done with the help of spinning
machines. After spinning, yarns are
used for making fabrics.

3.5 YARN

TO

FABRIC

There are many ways by which fabrics
are made from yarns. The two main
processes are weaving and knitting.

Weaving
In Activity 2, you might have noticed
that a fabric is made up of two sets of
yarns arranged together. The process of
arranging two sets of yarns together to
make a fabric is called weaving. Let us
try to weave some paper strips.

Activity 5
Take two sheets of paper of different
colours. Cut square pieces of length and
width equal to 30 cm from each sheet.
Now, fold both the sheets into half. On
one sheet draw lines as shown in the

in Fig.3.12 (b). Cut both the sheets
along the dotted lines and then unfold.
Weave the strips one by one through the
cuts in the sheet of paper as shown in
Fig.3.12 (c). Fig. 3.12 (d) shows the
pattern after weaving all the strips.
Fig 3.14 Knitting

used to make a piece of fabric (Fig. 3.14).
Have you ever pulled the yarn from a
torn pair of socks? What happens? A
single yarn gets pulled out continuously
as the fabric gets unravelled. Socks and
many other clothing items are made of
knitted fabrics. Knitting is done by
hand and also on machines.
Fig. 3.13 Handloom

In a similar manner, two sets of yarn
are woven to make a fabric. The yarns
are much thinner than our paper strips,
of course! Weaving of fabric is done on
looms (Fig. 3.13). The looms are either
hand operated or power operated.

Paheli wants to know if you have
seen any fabrics that are made
of the fibres on the outer covering
of coconut. What are these
fibres normally used for?

Knitting
Have you noticed how sweaters are
knitted? In knitting, a single yarn is

SCIENCE

Weaving and knitting are used for
making different kinds of fabric.
These fabrics are used for a variety of
clothing items.

3.6 HISTORY OF CLOTHING MATERIAL
Have you ever wondered what materials
people used in ancient times for clothes?
It appears that in those times people
used the bark and big leaves of trees or
animal skins and furs to cover
themselves.
After people began to settle in
agricultural communities, they learnt to
weave twigs and grass into mats and
baskets. Vines, animal fleece or hair were
twisted together into long strands. These
were woven into fabrics. The early Indians
wore fabrics made out of cotton that grew
in the regions near the river Ganga. Flax

is also a plant that gives natural fibres.
In ancient Egypt, cotton as well as flax
were cultivated near the river Nile and
were used for making fabrics.
In those days, stitching was not
known. People simply draped the fabrics
around different parts of their body.
Many different ways of draping fabrics
were used. With the invention of the
sewing needle, people started stitching
fabrics to make clothes. Stitched clothes
have gone through many variations
since this invention. But, is it not
amazing that even today saree, dhoti,
lungi or turban is used as an un-stitched
piece of fabric?
Just as there is a large variety in the
food eaten all over our country, a large
variety exists also in fabrics and
clothing items.

5.

You can do an activity to identify the yarns of a fabric under the supervision
of your teacher or parents. Pull out six to eight yarns from the fabric. Hold one
end of the yarn with a tong and bring the other end over the flame of a candle.
Observe carefully. Do the yarns shrink away from the flame? Do the yarns
melt or burn? What type of odour is given off? Note down your observations.
If these are cotton yarns, they burn but do not shrink or melt. The burning
yarn gives an odour similar to burning paper. The silk yarn shrinks away
from the flame and burns but does not melt. It has the odour of charred meat.
The wool yarn also shrinks and burns but does not melt. It has a strong odour
of burning hair. The synthetic yarns shrink and burn. They also melt and
give out an odour similar to burning plastics.

Boojho knows that burning of
cotton yarn gives an odour similar
to burning paper. He is wondering
if he can assume that paper is also
made from plants.

Sorting Materials into Groups

4.1 OBJECTS AROUND

US

We saw that our food and clothes have
so much variety in them. Not just food
and clothes, there is such a vast variety
of objects everywhere. We see around us,
a chair, a bullock cart, a cycle, cooking
utensils, books, clothes, toys, water,
stones and many other objects. All these
objects have different shapes, colours
and uses (Fig. 4.1).
Look around and identify objects
that are round in shape. Our list may
include a rubber ball, a football and a
glass marble. If we include objects that
are nearly round, our list could also
include objects like apples, oranges, and
an earthen pitcher (gharha). Suppose

we were looking for objects that are
edible. We might include all the items
that we have listed in Tables 1.1, 1.2
and 1.3 in Chapter 1. We might also
find that some of those round shaped
objects we just listed out, are also in
this group.
Let us say, we wish to make a group
of objects that are made of plastics.
Buckets, lunch boxes, toys, water
containers, pipes and many such
objects, may find a place in this group.
There are so many ways to group objects!
In the above examples we have grouped
objects on the basis of their shape or the
materials they are made from.
All objects around us are made of one
or more materials. These materials may
be glass, metal, plastics, wood, cotton,
paper, mud or soil. Can you think of
more examples of materials?

Activity 1

Fig. 4.1 Objects around us

Let us collect as many objects as
possible, from around us. Each of us
could get some everyday objects from
home and we could also collect some
objects from the classroom or from
outside the school. What will we have
in our collection? Chalk, pencil,
notebook, rubber, duster, a hammer,
nail, soap, spoke of a wheel, bat,

matchbox, salt, potato! We can also list
objects that we can think of, but, cannot
bring to the classroom. For example,
wall, trees, doors, tractor, road.
Separate all objects from this
collection that are made from paper or
wood. This way we have divided all objects
into two groups. One group has the
objects that are made from paper or wood
while the other group has the objects
that are not made of these materials.
Similarly, we could separate the things
that are used for preparing food.
Let us be a little more systematic. List
all objects collected, in Table 4.1. Try to
identify the materials that each one is
made of. It would be fun to make this a
large table – collecting information
about as many objects as possible. It
may seem difficult to find out the
materials out of which some of these
objects are made. In such cases, discuss
with your friends, teacher and parents
to identify the materials.

were used for making more than
one type of an object.

try and think of everyday objects you
know, that are made mainly of these
materials, and list them in Column 2.

What do we find from these tables?
First, we grouped objects in many
different ways. We then found that
objects around us are made of different
materials. At times, an object is made of
a single material. An object could also
be made of many materials. And then
again, one material could be used for
making many different objects. What
decides which material should be used
27

for making any given object? It seems
that we need to know more about
different materials.

4.2 PROPERTIES OF MATERIALS
Have you ever wondered why a tumbler
is not made with a piece of cloth? Recall
our experiments with pieces of cloth in
Chapter 3 and also keep in mind that
we generally use a tumbler to keep a
liquid. Therefore, would it not be silly,
if we were to make a tumbler out of cloth
(Fig 4.2)! What we need for a tumbler is
glass, plastics, metal or other such
material that will hold water. Similarly,
it would not be wise to use paper-like
materials for cooking vessels.

Fig. 4.2 Using a cloth tumbler

We see then, that we choose a
material to make an object depending
on its properties, and the purpose for
which the object is to be used.
So, what are all the properties of
materials that would be important for
their usage? Some properties are
discussed here.
28

Appearance
Materials usually look different from
each other. Wood looks very different
from iron. Iron appears different from
copper or aluminium. At the same time,
there may be some similarities between
iron, copper and aluminium that are not
there in wood.

Activity 3
Collect small pieces of different materials –
paper, cardboard, wood, copper wire,
aluminium sheet, chalk. Do any of these
appear shiny? Separate the shiny
materials into a group.
Now, observe as the teacher cuts each
material into two pieces and look at the
freshly cut surface (Fig. 4.3). What do
you notice? Does the freshly cut surface
of some of these materials appear shiny?
Include these objects also in the group
of shiny materials.
Do you notice such a shine or lustre
in the other materials, cut them anyway
as you can? Repeat this in the class with
as many materials as possible and make
a list of those with and without lustre.
Instead of cutting, you can rub the
surface of material with sand paper to
see if it has lustre.

Fig. 4.3 Cutting pieces of materials to see if they
have lustre
SCIENCE

Materials that have such lustre are
usually metals. Iron, copper, aluminium
and gold are examples of metals. Some
metals often lose their shine and
appear dull, because of the action of air
and moisture on them. We therefore,
notice the lustre, only on their freshly
cut sur face. When you visit an
ironsmith or a workshop, look out for
freshly cut surfaces of metal rods to see
if they have lustre.

beakers. Fill each one of them about twothirds with water. Add a small amount
(spoonful) of sugar to the first glass,
salt to the second and similarly, add
small amounts of the other substances
into the other glasses. Stir the contents
of each of them with a spoon. Wait for a
few minutes. Observe what happens to
the substances added to water (Fig. 4.4).
Note your observations as shown
in Table 4.3.

Hardness
When you press different materials with
your hands, some of them may be hard
to compress while others can be easily
compressed. Take a metal key and try
to scratch with it, the surface of a piece
of wood, aluminium, a piece of stone, a
nail, candle, chalk, any other material
or object. You can easily scratch some
materials, while some cannot be
scratched so easily. Materials which can
be compressed or scratched easily are
called soft while some other materials
which are difficult to compress are called
hard. For example, cotton or sponge is
soft while iron is hard.
In appearance, materials can have
different properties, like lustre,
hardness, be rough or smooth. Can you
think of other properties that describe
the appearance of a material?

Soluble or Insoluble?
Activity 4
Collect samples of some solid substances
such as sugar, salt, chalk powder, sand
and sawdust. Take five glasses or

You will notice that some substances
have completely disappeared or
dissolved in water. We say that these
substances are soluble in water. Other
substances do not mix with water and
do not disappear even after we stir for a
29

long time. These substances are
insoluble in water.
Water plays an important role in the
functioning of our body because it can
dissolve a large number of substances.
Do liquids also dissolve in water?

We notice that some liquids get
completely mixed with water. Some
others do not mix with water and form
a separate layer when kept aside for
some time.

Activity 5
Collect samples of vinegar, lemon juice,
mustard oil or coconut oil, kerosene or
any other liquid. Take a glass tumbler.
Fill it up to half with water. Add a few
spoonfuls of one liquid to this and stir
it well. Let it stand for five minutes.
Observe whether the liquid mixes with
water (Fig. 4.5). Repeat the same with
other liquids, as many different liquids
as are available to you. Write your
observations in Table 4.4.

30

Boojho suggests that we
also check if the liquids that we
used in Activity 5, mix well with
some liquid other than water.
Paheli is curious to know
whether gases also dissolve
in water.

Some gases are soluble in water
whereas others are not. Water, usually,
has small quantities of some gases
dissolved in it. For example, oxygen gas
dissolved in water is very important for
the survival of animals and plants that
live in water.

Objects may float or sink in
water
While doing Activity 4, you might have
noticed that the insoluble solids
separated out from water. You may have
also noticed this with some liquids in
Activity 5. Some of these materials that
did not mix with water, floated to the
surface of water. Others may have sunk
to the bottom of the tumbler, right? We
notice many examples of objects that
float in water or sink (Fig. 4.6). Dried
leaves fallen on the surface of a pond, a
stone that you throw into this pond, few

drops of honey that you let fall into a
glass of water. What happens to all
of these?
Boojho would like you to give him
five examples each, of objects that float
and those that sink in water. What
about testing these same materials to
see if they float or sink in other liquids
like oil?

Transparency
You might have played the game of hide
and seek. Think of some places where
you would like to hide so that you are
not seen by others. Why did you choose
those places? Would you have tried to

hide behind a glass window? Obviously
not, as your friends can see through that
and spot you. Can you see through all
the materials? Those substances or
materials, through which things can be
seen, are called transparent (Fig. 4.7).
Glass, water, air and some plastics are
examples of transparent materials.
Shopkeepers usually prefer to keep
biscuits, sweets and other eatables in
transparent containers of glass or

Fig. 4.8 Transparent bottles in a shop

plastic, so that buyers can easily see
these items (Fig. 4.8).
On the other hand, there are some
materials through which you are not
able to see. These materials are called
opaque. You cannot tell what is kept
in a closed wooden box, a cardboard
carton or a metal container. Wood,
cardboard and metals, are examples of
opaque materials.
Do we find that we can group all
materials and objects, without any
confusion, as either opaque or
transparent?

Activity 6
Fig. 4.7 Looking through opaque, transparent or
translucent material
SORTING MATERIALS INTO GROUPS

Take a sheet of paper and look through
it towards a lighted bulb. Make a note
of your observation. Now, put 2-3 drops

of some oil and spread it on the sheet of
paper. Look again towards the lighted
bulb through that portion of the paper
on which the oil has been spread. Do
you find that the bulb is more clearly
visible than before? But, can you see
clearly through the oiled paper? Is
everything on the other side of it visible?
Perhaps not. The materials through
which objects can be seen, but not
clearly, are known as translucent.
Remember the oily patch on paper when
we tested food items for presence of fats?
That was translucent too! Can you
think of some more examples of
translucent materials?
We can therefore group materials as
opaque, transparent and translucent.

whether palm of your hand is opaque,

We learnt that materials differ in their
appearance and the way they mix in
water or other liquids. They may float
or sink in water or may be transparent,
opaque or translucent. Materials can be
grouped on the basis of similarities or
differences in their properties.
Why do we need to group materials?
In everyday life, we often group materials
for our convenience. At home, we
usually store things in such a manner
that similar objects are placed together.
Such an arrangement helps us to locate
them easily. Similarly, a grocer usually
keeps all type of biscuits at one corner
of his shop, all soaps at another while
grains and pulses are stored at some
other place.
There is another reason why we find
such grouping useful. Dividing
materials in groups makes it convenient
to study their properties and also
observe any patterns in these properties.
We will study more about this in
higher classes.

of materials.
Tea leaves are separated from the
liquid with a strainer, while preparing
tea (Fig. 5.1).

Fig. 5.2 Butter is taken out by churning milk or
curds

Fig. 5.1 Separating tea leaves with a strainer

Grain is separated from stalks, while
harvesting. Milk or curd is churned to
separate the butter (Fig. 5.2). As we
learned in Chapter 3, we gin cotton to
separate its seeds from the fibre.
Perhaps you might
have eaten salted
daliya or poha. If you
found that it had
chillies in it, you may
have carefully taken
them out before eating.
Suppose you are given a basket
containing mangoes and guavas and
asked to separate them. What would you
do? Pick out one kind and place them
in a separate container, right?
Seems easy, but what if the materials
we want to separate are much smaller

than mango or guava? Imagine you are
given a glass of sand with salt mixed in
it. Impossible, even to think of
separating salt from this mixture by
picking out grains of sand by hand!
But, why would we need to
separate substances like this
at all, is what Paheli wants
to know.

Activity 1
In Column 1 of Table 5.1, are given a
few processes of separation. The purpose
of separation and the way separated
components are used is mentioned in
Column 2 and 3 respectively. However,
the information given in Columns 2 and

process with its purpose and the way
separated components are used?
We see that, befor e we use a
substance, we need to separate harmful
or non-useful substances that may be
mixed with it. Sometimes, we separate
even useful components if we need to
use them separately.
The substances to be separated may
be particles of different sizes or
materials. These may be solids, liquids
or even gases. So, how do we separate
substances mixed together if they have
so many different properties?

of paper? Are there pieces of stone,
husks, broken grain and particles of any
other grain in it? Now, remove with your
hand the pieces of stone, husks and
other grains from it.
This method of handpicking can
be used for separating slightly larger
sized impurities like the pieces of dirt,
stone, and husk from wheat, rice or
pulses (Fig. 5.3). The quantity of such
impurities is usually not very large.
In such situations, we find that
handpicking is a convenient method of
separating substances.

SEPARATION

We will discuss some simple methods of
separating substances that are mixed
together. You may come across some of
these methods being used in day to day
activities.

Hand Picking

Bring a packet of grain purchased from
a shop to the classroom. Now, spread
the grain on a sheet of paper. Do you
find only one kind of grain on the sheet
36

Threshing
You must have seen bundles of wheat
or paddy stalks lying in fields after
SCIENCE

harvesting the crop. Stalks are dried in
the sun before the grain is separated
from them. Each stalk has many grain
seeds attached to it. Imagine the
number of grain seeds in hundreds of
bundles of stalk lying in the field! How
does the farmer separate grain seeds
from those bundles of stalks?
One may pluck mangoes or guavas
from the trees. But, grain seeds are
much smaller than mangoes or guavas.
So, plucking them from their stalks
would be impossible. How does one
separate grain seeds from their stalks?
The process that is used to separate
grain from stalks is threshing. In this
process, the stalks are beaten to free the
grain seeds (Fig. 5.4). Sometimes,

this mixture on a plate or a newspaper.
Look at this mixture carefully. Can the
two different components be made out
easily? Are the sizes of particles of the
two components similar? Would it be
possible to separate the components by
handpicking?
Now, take your mixture to an open
ground and stand on a raised platform.
Put the mixture in a plate or sheet of
paper. Hold the plate or the sheet of
paper containing the mixture, at your
shoulder height. Tilt it slightly, so that
the mixture slides out slowly.
What happens? Do both the
components — sand and sawdust (or
powdered leaves) fall at the same place?
Is there a component that blows away?
Did the wind manage to separate the
two components?
This method of separating
components of a mixture is called
winnowing. Winnowing is used to
separate heavier and lighter components
of a mixture by wind or by blowing air.

Fig. 5.4 Threshing

threshing is done with the help of
bullocks. Machines are also used to
thresh large quantities of grain.

This method is commonly used by
farmers to separate lighter husk particles
from heavier seeds of grain (Fig. 5.5).
The husk particles are carried away
by the wind. The seeds of grain get
separated and form a heap near the
platform for winnowing. The separated
husk is used for many purposes such
as fodder for cattles.

Sieving
Sometimes, we may wish to prepare a
dish with flour. We need to remove
impurities and bran that may be present
in it. What do we do? We use a sieve
and pour the flour into it (Fig. 5.6).
Sieving allows the fine flour particles
to pass through the holes of the sieve
while the bigger impurities remain on
the sieve.
In a flour mill, impurities like husk
and stones are removed from wheat
before grinding it. Usually, a bagful of
wheat is poured on a slanting sieve. The
sieving removes pieces of stones, stalk
and husk that may still remain with
wheat after threshing and winnowing.

Fig. 5.6 Sieving

You may have also noticed similar
sieves being used at construction sites
38

Fig. 5.7 Pebbles and stones are removed from
sand by sieving

to separate pebbles and stones from
sand (Fig. 5.7).

Activity 4
Bring a sieve and a small quantity of
flour from home, to the class. Sieve the
flour to separate any impurities in it.
Now, make a fine powder of chalk pieces
and mix it with the flour. Can we
separate the flour and the powdered
chalk by sieving?
Sieving is used when components of
a mixture have different sizes.

Sedimentation, Decantation
and Filtration
Sometimes, it may not be possible to
separate components of a mixture by
winnowing and handpicking. For
example, there may be lighter impurities
like dust or soil particles in rice or
pulses. How are such impurities
separated from rice or pulses before
cooking?
Rice or pulses are usually washed
before cooking. When you add water to
these, the impurities like dust and soil
SCIENCE

particles get separated. These impurities
go into water, which becomes a little
muddy. Now, what will sink to the
bottom of the vessel — rice or dust?
Why? Have you seen that the vessel is
tilted to pour out the dirty water?
When the heavier component in a
mixture settles after water is added to
it, the process is called sedimentation.
When the water (along with the dust) is
removed, the process is called
decantation (Fig. 5.8). Let us find a
few other mixtures that can be separated
through
sedimentation
and
decantation.
The same principle is used for
separating a mixture of two liquids that
do not mix with each other. For example,
oil and water from their mixture can be
separated by this process. If a mixture of
such liquids is allowed to stand for some
time, they form two separate layers. The
component that forms the top layer can
then be separated by decantation.
Let us again consider a mixure of a
solid and liquid. After preparing tea,
what do you do to remove the tea leaves?
Try decantation. It helps a little. But,
do you still get a few leaves in your tea?
Now, pour the tea through a strainer.

Fig. 5.8 Separating two components of a mixture
by sedimentation and decantation
SEPARATION OF SUBSTANCES

Did all the tea leaves remain in the
strainer? This process is called filtration
(Fig. 5.1). Which method of separating
tea leaves from prepared tea is better,
decantation or filtration?
Let us now consider the example
of water that we use. Do all of us, at
all times, get safe water to drink?
Sometimes, water supplied through taps
may be muddy. The water collected from
ponds or rivers may also be muddy,
especially after rains. Let us see if we
can use some method of separation to
remove insoluble impurities like soil
from the water.

Activity 5
Collect some muddy water from a pond
or a river. If it is not available, mix some
soil to water in a glass. Let it stand for
half an hour. Observe the water
carefully and note your observations.
Does some soil settle at the bottom
of water? Why? What will you call this
process?
Now, slightly tilt the glass without
disturbing the water. Let the water from
the top flow into another glass (Fig. 5.8).
What will you call this process?
Is the water in the second glass still
muddy or brown in colour? Now filter
it. Did the tea strainer work? Let us try
filtering the water through a piece of
cloth. In a piece of cloth, small holes or
pores remain in between the woven
threads. These pores in a cloth can be
used as a filter.
If the water is still muddy, impurities
can be separated by a filter that has even
39

smaller pores. A filter paper is one such
filter that has very fine pores in it.
Fig. 5.9 shows the steps involved in
using a filter paper. A filter paper folded
in the form of a cone is fixed onto a
funnel (Fig. 5.10). The mixture is then
poured on the filter paper. Solid
particles in the mixture do not pass
through it and remain on the filter.
Fig. 5.11 Heating a beaker containing salt water

Fig. 5.9 Folding a filter

Fig. 5.10 Filtration

Fruit and vegetable juices are usually
filtered before drinking to separate the
seeds and solid particles of pulp. The
method of filtration is also used in the
process of preparing cottage cheese
(paneer) in our homes. You might have
seen that for making paneer, a few drops
of lemon juice are added to milk as it
boils. This gives a mixture of particles
of solid paneer and a liquid. The paneer
is then separated by filtering the mixture
through a fine cloth or a strainer.

Evaporation
Activity 6
Heat a beaker containing some water.
Allow the water to boil. If you continue
heating, would the water turn into steam
40

and disappear completely? Now, add two
spoons of salt to water in another beaker
and stir it well. Do you see any change
in the colour of water? Can you see any
salt in the beaker, after stirring? Heat
the beaker containing the salt water
(Fig. 5.11). Let the water boil away. What
is left in the beaker?
In this activity, we used the process
of evaporation, to separate a mixture of
water and salt.
The process of conversion of water
into its vapour is called evaporation.
The process of evaporation takes place
continuously wherever water is present.
Where do you think, salt comes
from? Sea water contains many salts
mixed in it. One of these salts is the
common salt. When sea water is allowed
to stand in shallow pits, water gets
heated by sunlight and slowly turns into
water vapour, through evaporation. In
a few days, the water evaporates
completely leaving behind the solid salts
(Fig. 5.12). Common salt is then
obtained from this mixture of salts by
further purification.
SCIENCE

Fig. 5.12 Obtaining salt from sea water

Use of more than one method
of separation
We have studied some methods for
separation of substances from their
mixtures. Often, one method is not
sufficient to separate the different
substances present in a mixture. In such
a situation, we need to use more than
one of these methods.

Activity 7
Take a mixture of sand and salt. How
will we separate these? We already saw
that handpicking would not be a
practical method for separating these.
Keep this mixture in a beaker and
add some water to this. Leave the beaker
aside for some time. Do you see the sand
settling down at the bottom? The sand
can be separated by decantation or
filtration. What does the decanted liquid
contain? Do you think this water
contains the salt which was there in the
mixture at the beginning?
Now, we need to separate salt and
water from the decanted liquid. Transfer
this liquid to a kettle and close its lid.
Heat the kettle for some time. Do you
SEPARATION OF SUBSTANCES

notice steam coming out from the spout
of the kettle?
Take a metal plate with some ice on
it. Hold the plate just above the spout
of the kettle as shown in Fig. 5.13. What
do you observe? Let all the water in the
kettle boil off.
When the steam comes in contact
with the metal plate cooled with ice, it
condenses and forms liquid water. The
water drops that you observed falling
from the plate, were due to condensation
of steam. The process of conversion of
water vapour into its liquid form is
called condensation.
Did you ever see water drops
condensed under a plate that has been
used to cover a vessel containing milk
that has just been boiled?
After all the water has evaporated,
what is left behind in the kettle?
We have thus, separated salt, sand
and water using processes of
decantation, filtration, evaporation and
condensation.
Paheli faced a problem while
recovering salt mixed with sand. She
has mixed a packet of salt in a small

Fig. 5.13 Evaporation and condensation
41

amount of sand. She then tried the
method suggested in Activity 7, to
recover the salt. She found, however,
that she could recover only a small part
of the salt that she had taken. What
could have gone wrong?

Can water dissolve any
amount of a substance?
In chapter 4, we found that many
substances dissolve in water and form
a solution. We say that these substances
are soluble in water. What will happen
if we go on adding more and more of
these substances to a fixed quantity of
water?

Activity 8
You will need a beaker or a small pan, a
spoon, salt and water. Pour half a cup
of water in the beaker. Add one
teaspoonful of salt and stir it well, until
the salt dissolves completely (Fig 5.14).
Again add a teaspoonful of salt and stir
well. Go on adding salt, one teaspoonful
at a time, and stir.
After adding a few spoons of salt, do
you find that some salt remains
undissolved and settles at the bottom
of the beaker? If yes, this means that
no more salt can be dissolved in the
amount of water we have taken. The
solution is now said to be saturated.
Here is a hint as to what might have
gone wrong when Paheli tried to recover
large quantity of salt mixed with sand.
Perhaps the quantity of salt was much
more than that required to form a
saturated solution. The undissolved salt
42

Fig 5.14 Dissolving salt in water

would have remained mixed with the
sand and could not be recovered. She
could solve her problem by using a
larger quantity of water.
Suppose, she did not have sufficient
quantity of water to dissolve all the salt
in the mixture. Is there some way that
water could be made to dissolve more
salt before the solution gets saturated?
Let us try and help Paheli out.

Activity 9
Take some water in a beaker and mix
salt in it until it cannot dissolve any
more salt. This will give you a saturated
solution of salt in water.
Now, add a small quantity of salt to
this saturated solution and heat it. What
do you find? What happens to the
undissolved salt in the bottom of the
beaker? Does it dissolve, now? If yes,
can some more salt be dissolved in this
solution by heating it?
Let this hot solution cool. Does the
salt appear to settle at the bottom of the
beaker again?
The activity suggest that larger
quantity of salt can be dissolved in water
on heating.

Does water dissolve equal amounts
of different soluble substances? Let us
find out.

of salt that dissolved in the water, in
Table 5.2. Now, repeat the same
activity with sugar. Repeat this with
some other substances that are soluble

How can we group various changes?
It might help, if we find some similarities
between them.

Take a balloon and blow it. Take care
that it does not burst. The shape and
size of the balloon have changed
(Fig. 6.1). Now, let the air escape the
balloon.
We do not have magical powers, of
course. But, we can still change a few
things around us, perhaps many things.
Can you list a few things you can
change around you, with no magic
involved?
Many changes are taking place
around us on their own. In the fields,
the crops change from time to time.
Sometimes, leaves fall from trees, change
colour and dry out. The flowers bloom
and then wither away. Are any changes
happening in your body? Your nails
grow, your hair grows, you grow taller
and your weight increases as you grow.
Did you realise earlier that so many
changes are taking place around you all
the time?

What do they have in common?
Was it possible to get the balloon back

Was the size of the paper same as
before and after making an aeroplane?
Was it possible to get back the ball of
dough again?
What do you conclude? In each of
the three activities, is it possible to get
back to the material with which we
started our activity? If the answer is yes,
it means that the changes occurring in
these activities can be reversed. Now, let
us repeat the same activities with
a difference.

6.2 COULD THERE BE OTHER WAYS
TO BRING A CHANGE?
We all have seen the tools which are used
to dig the soil (Fig. 6.6 ). Have you ever
seen how the iron blade in these tools
is fixed to the wooden handle?
The iron blade of these tools has a
ring in which the wooden handle is
fixed. Normally, the ring is slightly
smaller in size than the wooden handle.
To fix the handle, the ring is heated and
it becomes slightly larger in size
(expands). Now, the handle easily fits
into the ring. When the ring cools down
it contracts and fits tightly on to
the handle.

expands and fits onto the wheel. Cold
water is then poured over the rim, which
contracts and fits tightly onto the wheel.

When we heat water in a pan, it
begins to boil after some time. If we
continue to heat further, the quantity
of water in the pan begins to decrease.
The water changes into its vapour.
In Activity 7, Chapter 5 you have
observed that water vapour gets changed
into liquid water when it is cooled. We
all have noticed melting of ice. Ice melts
when it is heated. What does it change
into? Is it possible to change this water
back into ice?
Let us observe some more changes.

Paheli wants to know if
you have ever seen a
blacksmith making some
tools. How does a
blacksmith change a
piece of iron into different tools? A
piece of iron is heated till it becomes
red-hot. It then becomes soft and is
beaten into a desired shape. What
change has taken place in iron, on
being heated?

Take a small candle and measure its
length with a scale. Now, fix it at a
suitable place and light it. Let it burn
for some time. Now blow out the candle
and measure its length again (Fig.6.8).

candle be reversed? If we were to take
some wax in a pan and heat it, can this
change be reversed (Fig. 6.9)?

Repeat Activity 7 with an incense
stick. Wait till it burns away completely.
What are the changes that occur in the
incense stick? The stick burns to
produce some new material. These are
ash and some gases. We cannot see
these gases but can sense them due to
their pleasant smell. Can this change
be reversed? And what about the
change, which occurred in the
matchstick you used for lighting the
candle or incense stick?
So far we have discussed the changes
occurring in a given object or its
material. What about the changes
that occur when two substances are
mixed together?
In Chapter 4, we dissolved salt in
water. Do you think a change occured
in salt or in water? Is it possible to
reverse this change? Wait, in Chapter
5, we learnt how to separate salt from
its solution in water. So, can we say that

the change due to dissolving salt in
water be reversed?
Paheli asks if you have ever seen curd
being set. A small quantity of curd is
added to warm milk. The milk is stirred
and is set aside for a few hours at a warm
place. In a few hours, the milk changes
into curd. Can this change be reversed?
We find that a few ways to bring about
a change in a substance could be, by
heating it or by mixing it with some
other substance. We also find that some
changes can be reversed, while some
others cannot be reversed. There must
be many other ways of changing things
around us. It is possible that some of
them could be reversed. Thus, changes
around us could be grouped as those
that can be reversed or cannot be
reversed. In higher classes, you will
learn more about the ways in which
changes can be made and the way these
can be grouped.

SUGGESTED PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES
1. Take a lemon, a paintbrush and a piece of paper. Cut the lemon and squeeze
out its juice in a cup. Dip the brush in the lemon juice and write a message
on the paper. Let the paper dry and you find that the letters of your message
become invisible. Now, press the paper with hot iron or warm it by holding it
above the flame of a candle (Take care that it does not catch fire). As the
paper gets warm, invisible letters change into dark brown colour. Identify the
changes that can be reversed.
2. Observe preparation of dishes at your home. Identify two changes that can
be reversed.
3. Maintain a record for one year of the seasonal changes in vegetables, clothing,
nature and events around you. Identify the changes that can or cannot be
reversed.

o outside and observe all the
plants around you. Do you see
that some plants are small,
some very big, while some are just
patches of green on the soil?
Some have green leaves,
while some others have
reddish ones. Some have
huge red flowers, some have
tiny blue ones, while some
have none. We do see a
variety of plants existing all
around us — near our
homes, in the school
ground, on the way to the
school, in the parks and
gardens, isn’t it?
Let us get to know the different
parts of any plant. This will help us
understand the differences between

plants of different kinds. Can you label
the stem, branches, roots, leaves, and
flowers of the plant shown in Fig.7.1?
Colour the parts of the plant.

Let us now go on a Nature walk,
make friends with many different
kinds of plants and examine them
closely (Fig. 7.2).

We will now group all the plants we
observed, in Table 7.1. Some examples
are shown. You can fill the Columns 1,
Suggestion: Work in groups of 4-5
students in doing activities suggested
in this Chapter so that a minimum
number of plants are uprooted.
Use weeds with soft stems for the
activities. Do you know what weeds
are? In crop fields, lawns, or in pots,
often some unwanted plants or
weeds start growing. Have you seen
farmers removing these weeds from
their fields?

Plants with green and tender stems
are called herbs. They are usually short
and may not have many branches
[Fig.7.3 (a)].
Some plants have the stem
branching out near the base. The stem
is hard but not very thick. Such plants
are called shrubs [Fig .7.3(b)].
Some plants are very tall and have
hard and thick brown stem. The stems
have branches in the upper part, much
above the ground. Such plants are
called trees [Fig.7.3(c)].
Based on the above characteristics
can you now correctly classify the plants

Perhaps there are some plants in
your school or at home that you take

two trees, shrubs, herbs or creepers
growing in your house or school.

upwards?

Plants with weak
stems that cannot stand

creepers, while those
that take support on
neighbouring structures
and climb up are called

Fig.7.5. Observe it the next day.
Do any of the parts of the herb appear
to have red colour? If yes, how do you
think the colour reached there?
You can cut the stem across and
look for the red colour inside the stem
( Fig. 7.6) .
From this activity we see that water
moves up the stem. In other words, stem
conducts water. Just like the red ink,
minerals dissolved in water also move
up in the stem, along with the water.

The water and minerals go to leaves and

Paheli did this activity with herbs
having white flowers. She put one
branch with a white flower in the water
in glass A and added a few drops of red
ink to the water. She did a funny thing
with another branch. She split it half
way along its length and put the two

Look at leaves of plants around you and
draw them in your notebook. Are all the
leaves the same in size, shape and
colour?
How are they attached to the stem?
The part of a leaf by which it is attached
to the stem is called petiole. The broad,
green part of the leaf is called lamina
(Fig. 7.8). Can you identify these parts
of the leaves in plants around you? Do
all the leaves have petioles?

She wants you to guess what would
happen to the flower in glass A and the

When you had cut across the stem
in Activity 2, did you notice a number
of spots of red colour arranged in a ring
inside the stem? Does this explain the
results that Paheli obtained? Try this
activity yourself!
GETTING TO KNOW PLANTS

Put a leaf under a white sheet of paper
or a sheet in your notebook. Hold it in
place as shown in Fig. 7.9. Hold your
pencil tip sideways and rub it on the
portion of the paper having the leaf below
it. Did you get an
impression with
some lines in it?
Are they similar to
those on the leaf?
These lines on
the leaf are called
veins. Do you see

middle of the leaf? This vein is called the
midrib. The design made by veins in a
leaf is called the leaf venation. If this
design is net-like on both sides of
midrib, the venation is reticulate
[Fig. 7.10 (a)]. In the leaves of grass you
might have seen that the veins are parallel
to one another. This is parallel venation
[(Fig. 7.10 (b)]. Observe the venation in
as many leaves as you can without
removing them from the plant. Draw the
pattern and write names of some plants
having reticulate and parallel venation.
Shall we now find out some of the
functions of a leaf?

Activity 4
We will require a herb, two transparent
polythene bags and some string.
Do this activity during day time on a
sunny day. Use a healthy, well watered
plant that has been growing in the sun,
for this activity. Enclose a leafy branch
of the plant in a polythene bag and tie
up its mouth as shown in Fig. 7.11. Tie
up the mouth of the empty polythene
bag and keep it also in the sun.
After a few hours, observe the inner
surface of the bags. What do you see?
56

Fig. 7.11 What does the leaf do?

Are there any droplets of water in any
of the bags? Which bag has the droplets?
How do you think they got there? [Don’t
forget to remove the polythene bag after
the activity!]
Water comes out of leaves in the form
of vapour by a process called
transpiration. Plants release a lot of water
into the air through this process. We will
learn more about this in Chapter 14.
Why did we tie a bag around the
leaves? Would we have seen the water
from the transpiration of plants
otherwise? What makes the water
appear on the polythene bag? In
Chapter 5, we noticed water changing
into different forms in some of our
activities. Can you think of these and
name the process that makes water
drops appear on the polythene bag?
Leaves also have another function.
Let us study this.

Activity 5
We would require a leaf, spirit, a beaker,
test tube, burner, water, a plate and
iodine solution for this activity.
Put a leaf in a test tube and pour
spirit to completely cover the leaf. Now,
SCIENCE

Fig. 7.12 What does the leaf contain?

put the test tube in a beaker half filled
with water. Heat the beaker till all the
green colour from the leaf comes out
into the spirit in the test tube. Take out
the leaf carefully and wash it in water.
Put it on a plate and pour some iodine
solution over it (Fig. 7.12).
Note: Since the activity involves the
use of spirit and heating, it is advised
that it is demonstrated by the teacher
in the class.
What do you observe? Compare your
observations with those done in
Chapter 2, when you tested food for
presence of different nutrients. Does this
mean that the leaf has starch in it?
In Chapter 2, we saw that a slice of
raw potato also shows the presence of
starch. Potatoes get this starch from
other parts of the plant and store it.
However, leaves prepared their food in
the presence of sunlight and a green
coloured substance present in them. For
this, they use water and carbon dioxide
from air. This process is called
photosynthesis. Oxygen is given out in
this process. The food prepared by leaves
GETTING TO KNOW PLANTS

ultimately gets stored in different parts
of plant as starch.
How do we know that the leaf has
prepared the starch and not received it
from another part of the plant? To test
this, the above activity can be repeated
with a little difference.
Place a potted plant with green
leaves, in a dark room for a day or two.
Now, cover a portion of a leaf of the plant
completely with black paper and leave
the plant in the Sun for a day. Remove
the leaf covered in black paper and
repeat the test for starch.
What do you see? Which part of the
leaf shows the presence of starch? Does
this help us understand that leaves
produce starch in the presence
of sunlight?
We see that the stem supplies leaf
with water. The leaf uses the water to
make food. The leaves also lose water
through transpiration.How do the stem
and leaves get the water? That is where
the roots come in!

7.4 ROOT
Look at Fig. 7.13. Who do you think is
watering their plant correctly, Paheli or
Boojho? Why?

Fig. 7.13 Watering the plants
57

Which part of the plant is in the soil?
Let us learn more about this part from
the following activities.

Activity 6
You would require two pots, some soil,
khurpi (for digging), blade or a pair of
scissors and water. This activity is to be
done in groups of 4-5 students.
Select two weeds of the same kind
from an open ground and dig them out.
Take care that their roots do not break.
Plant one of the weeds in the soil in pot
A [Fig. 7.14 (a)]. Cut off the roots from
the other weed and plant it in the soil
in pot B [Fig. 7.14 (b)]. Water them
regularly. Observe the plants after a
week. Are both plants healthy?

Activity 7
We would require seeds of gram and
maize, cotton wool, katori and some
water.
Take two katoris. Place some wet
cotton wool in them. Put 3 or 4 seeds
of gram in one and maize in the other.
Keep the cotton wet by sprinkling
water every day, until the sprouts have
grown into young plants. After a week
try to separate the young plants from
the cotton wool (Fig. 7.15).

Both the plants are watered
regularly, but, one is without roots, isn’t
it? Does this activity help you
understand an important function of the
root?
Let us do an activity to study another
function of root.
58

Was it easy to separate the cotton wool
from the roots? Why?
In Activity 6, we could not easily pull
out the plants from the soil, right? We
dug them out. The roots help in holding
the plant firmly in the soil. They are said
to anchor the plant to the soil.
You have seen that there are different
kinds of stems and leaves. Do the roots
also show a variety? Let us find out.

Activity 8
Study Fig. 7.16 (a) and (b) carefully.
Now, look at the roots of the gram plants
you have pulled out from the cotton
wool. Do they look like the roots shown
in Fig. 7.16 (a) or those in Fig. 7.16 (b)?

How about the roots of the maize plant?
Write ‘gram’ or ‘maize’ in the blank
spaces in the figure after matching the
roots with the figures.
In what way are the roots of gram
and maize similar? In what way are they
different? There seem to be two different
types of roots, isn’t it? Are there also
other types of roots? Let us find out.

Activity 9
Go to an open ground where many
weeds are growing. Dig out a few weeds,
wash the soil off the roots and observe
them. Do you find that all the weeds
that you have dug out have either the
kind of roots shown in Fig. 7.17 (a) or
as in Fig. 7.17 (b)?

For roots of the kind shown in
Fig.7.17 (a), the main root is called tap
root and the smaller roots are called
lateral roots. Plants with roots as shown
in Fig. 7.17 (b) do not have any main
root. All roots seem similar and these
are called fibrous roots.
Separate the weeds you have collected
into (a) those that have tap roots and
(b) those that have fibrous roots. Look
at the leaves of the plants in Group (a).
What kind of venation do they have?
What kind of venation do you see for
plants of Group (b)?
Do you notice that leaf venation and
the type of roots in a plant are related
in a very interesting way? In Table 7.2,
can you match the type of leaf venation
and the type of roots for some plants
you have studied in all the activities
so far?
Boojho has a brilliant idea! If he
wants to know what kind of roots a
plant has, he need not pull it out.
He just has to look at its leaves!

We have learnt that roots absorb
water and minerals from the soil and
the stem conducts these to leaves and

other parts of the plant. The leaves
prepare food. This food travels through
the stem and is stored in different parts
of a plant. We eat some of these as roots—
like carrot, radish, sweet potato, turnip
and tapioca. We also eat many other
parts of a plant where the food is stored.
Do you agree that stem is like a two
way street? Write down what goes up
the stem and what comes down,
in Fig. 7.18.

Which colour did you use for the
flower in Fig. 7.1? Are all flowers
colourful? Have you ever seen flowers
on the plants of grass, wheat, maize,
mango or guava? If you see any flowers
in these plants, are they brightly
coloured?
Let us study a few flowers closely.
When choosing flowers to study, avoid
using marigold, chrysanthemum or
sunflower. You will learn in higher
classes that they are not single flowers,
but, groups of flowers.

about the structure of a flower.

7.5 FLOWER
You are shown three branches of a rose
in Fig 7.19 (a), (b) and (c). Which one
will help you best to recognize the plant?

We would require one bud and two fresh
flowers each, of any of the following–
datura, china rose, mustard, brinjal,
lady’s finger, gulmohur. Also a blade, a
glass slide or a sheet of paper, a
magnifying glass and water.
Observe Fig. 7.20 carefully. Look at
the prominent parts of the open flower.
These are the petals of the flower.
Different flowers have petals of different
colours.

part in a bud? Did you see that this part
is made of small leaf-like structures? They

observations of the whole class
(Table 7.3). Add observations to this
table, from a field trip to a locality where
there are plants with flowers. Fill the
last two columns after you have gone
through the entire section.
To see the inner parts of the flower
clearly, you have to cut it open, if its
petals are joined. For example, in datura
and other bell shape flowers, the petals
have to be cut lengthwise and spread
out so that the inner parts can be seen
clearly (Fig. 7.21).
Remove the sepals and petals to see
the rest of the parts. Study the Fig. 7.22

using a lens (Fig. 7.26). Do you see some
small bead like structures inside the
ovary? They are called ovules. Draw and
label the inner parts of the ovary in your
notebook.
On your field trip, try to find out the
names of as many of the flowers as you
can by asking the gardener or any other
person. Remember, not to pluck more
flowers than you need. Based on what
you have filled in Table 7.3, answer the
following questions.
Do all flowers have sepals, petals,
stamens and pistils? Are there flowers that
do not have any of these? Are there flowers
which have parts other than these?
Did you find any flowers which have
sepals and petals that look similar?
Did you find any flowers in which
the number of sepals is different from
the number of petals?
SCIENCE

Do you now agree that the structure
of the flower is not always the same?
The number of sepals, petals, stamens
and pistils may also be different in
different flowers. Sometimes, some of
these parts may even be absent!

We have studied some features and
functions of leaves, stems and roots.
We studied the structure of different
flowers. We will learn about the function
of flowers in higher classes. We will also

Roots absorb water and minerals from the soil and anchor the plant
firmly in the soil.
Roots are mainly of two types: tap root and fibrous roots.
Plants having leaves with reticulate venation have tap roots while plants
having leaves with parallel venation have fibrous roots.
The stem conducts water from roots to the leaves (and other parts) and
food from leaves to other parts of the plant.
The parts of a flower are sepals, petals, stamens and pistil.

Do this activity with a number of leaves over a period of a few weeks. For
every leaf that you wish to study, pluck it and wrap it in a wet cloth and take
it home. Now, put your leaf in a newspaper and place a heavy book on it. You
can also put it under your mattress or a trunk! Take out the leaf after a

it absolutely still. Observe the
movements taking place in your
body. You must be blinking your
eyes, time to time. Observe the
movements in your body as you
breathe. There are so many movements
that happen in our bodies.
When you are writing in your
notebook which part of the body are you
moving? Or, when you turn and look at
your friend? Different parts of your body
move while you remain at the same
place, in these examples. You also move
from one place to another — you get up
and go to your teacher or to the school
compound, or go home after school. You
walk, run, skip, jump and move from
place to place.
Let us see how animals move from
place to place by filling up Table 8.1,
after discussing with our friends,
teachers and parents.

Boojho wonders about movements
in plants. He knows they do not
move from place to place, but, do
they show any other kind of
movements?

Walk, run, fly, jump, creep, crawl,
slither and swim – these are only a few
of the ways in which animals move from
one place to another. Why are there so
many differences in the way that
animals move from place to place? Why
is it that many animals walk while a
snake slithers or crawls and a fish
swims?

8.1 HUMAN BODY AND ITS MOVEMENTS
Let us look closely at some of our own
movements to begin with, before looking
at all these varieties of movements in
animals.
Do you enjoy doing physical exercise
at school? How do you move your hands
and legs while doing different exercises?

Let us try some of the many movements,
our body is capable of.
Bowl an imaginary ball at an
imaginary wicket. How did you move
your arm? Did you rotate it at the
shoulder in a circular movement? Did
your shoulder also move? Lie down and
rotate your leg at the hip. Bend your
arm at the elbow and the leg at the knee.
Stretch your arm sideways. Bend your
arm to touch your shoulder with your
fingers. Which part of your arm did you
bend? Straighten your arm and try to
bend it downwards. Are you able to do
it?
Try to move the various parts of your
body and record their movements in
Table 8.2.

Why is it that we are able to move a
few parts of our body easily in various
directions and some only in one
direction? Why are we unable to move
some parts at all?

Activity 1
Place a scale length-wise on your arm
so that your elbow is in the centre
(Fig. 8.1).
Ask your friend to tie the scale and
your arm together. Now,
try to bend your elbow.
Are you able to do it?

Fig. 8.1 Can you bend your
arm now?

Did you notice that we are able to
bend or rotate our body in places where
two parts of our body seem to be joined
together — like elbow, shoulder or neck?
These places are called joints. Can you
name more such joints? If our body has
no joints, do you think it would be
possible for us to move in any way at
all?
What exactly is joined together at
these joints?
Press your fingers against the top of
your head, face, neck, nose, ear, back of
the shoulder, hands and legs including
the fingers and toes.
Do you get a feel of something hard
pressing against your fingers? The hard
structures are the bones. Repeat this
activity on other parts of your body. So
many bones!
Bones cannot be bent. So, how do
we bend our elbow? It is not one long
bone from the upper arm to our wrist. It
is different bones joined together at the
elbow. Similarly, there are many bones
present in each part of the body. We
can bend or move our body only at those
points where bones meet.
There are different types of joints in
our body to help us carry out different
movements and activities. Let us learn
about some of them.

Fig. 8.2 Making a ball and socket joint

paper cylinder into it as in Fig. 8.2. You
can also stick the cylinder on the ball.
Put the ball in a small bowl. Is the ball
rotating freely inside the bowl? Is the
paper cylinder also rotating?
Now, imagine that the paper cylinder
is your arm and the ball is its end. The
bowl is like the part of the shoulder to
which your arm is joined. The rounded
end of one bone fits into the cavity
(hollow space) of the other bone
(Fig.8.3). Such a joint allows movements
in all directions. Can you name another
such joint you can think of, recollecting
the body movements we tried at the
beginning of this section?

Ball and socket joints
Activity 2
Roll a strip of paper into a cylinder. Make
a small hole in an old rubber or plastic
ball (under supervision) and push the
68

Fig. 8.3 A ball and socket joint

Pivotal Joint
The joint where our neck joins the head
is a pivotal joint. It allows us to bend
SCIENCE

our head forward and backward and
turn the head to our right or left. Try
these movements. How are these
movements different from those of our
arm that can rotate a complete circle in
its ball and socket joint? In a pivotal
joint a cylindrical bone rotates in a ring.

Hinge joints
Open and close a door a few times.
Observe the hinges of the door carefully.
They allow the door to move back
and forth.

Activity 3
Let us look at the kind of movement
allowed by a hinge. Make a cylinder with
cardboard or thick chart paper, as
shown in Fig. 8.4. Attach a small pencil
to the cylinder by piercing the cylinder
at the centre, as shown. Make a hollow
half cylinder from cardboard such that
the rolled up cylinder can fit inside it
easily. The hollow half cylinder with the
rolled up cylinder sitting inside it, allows
movement like a hinge. Try to move the
rolled up cylinder. How does it move?
How is this movement different from
what we saw with our constructed ball

Fig. 8.4 Directions of movement allowed by a hinge
like joint
BODY MOVEMENTS

Fig. 8.5 Hinge joints of the knee

and socket joint? We saw this kind of
movement at the elbow in Activity 1.
What we have constructed in Fig. 8.4 is
different from a hinge, of course. But, it
illustrates the direction in which a hinge
allows movement. The elbow has a hinge
joint that allows only a back and forth
movement (Fig. 8.5). Can you think of
more examples of such joints?

Fixed joints
There are some bones in our head that
are joined together at some joints. The
bones cannot move at these joints. Such
joints are called fixed joints. When you
open your mouth wide, you can move
your lower jaw away from your head,
isn’t it? Try to move your upper jaw,
now. Are you able to move it? There is a
joint between the upper jaw and the rest
of the head which is a fixed joint.
We discussed only some of the joints
that connect parts of our body.
What gives the different parts of the
body their different shapes?
If you wanted to make a doll, what
will you make first? Perhaps a
framework to give the doll shape before
making its outer structure, isn’t it? All
69

Feel the bones in your forearm,
upper arm, lower leg and upper leg. Try
to find the number of bones in each part.
Similarly, feel the bones of your ankle
and knee joints and compare these with
the X-ray images (Fig. 8.7).

Fig. 8.6 The Human skeleton

the bones in our body also form a
framework to give a shape to our body.
This framework is called the skeleton
(Fig. 8.6.)
How do we know that this is the
shape of a human skeleton? How do we
know the shapes of the different bones
in our body? We can have some idea
about the shape and number of bones
in some parts of our body by feeling
them. One way we could know this
shape better would be to look at X-ray
images of the human body.
Did you or anyone in your family
ever have an X-ray of any part of your
body taken? Sometimes when we are
hurt, or have an accident, doctors use
these X-ray images to find out about
any possible injuries that might
have happened to the bones. The Xrays show the shapes of the bones in
our bodies.
70

Fig 8.7 X-ray images of ankle and knee joints

Bend your fingers. Are you able to
bend them at every joint? How many
bones does your middle finger have?
Feel the back of your palm. It seems to
have many bones, isn’t it (Fig. 8.8)? Is
your wrist flexible? It is made up of
several small bones. What will happen
if it has only one bone?

Take a deep breathe and hold it for a
little while. Feel your chest bones and the
back bone by gently pressing the middle

of the chest and back at the same time.
Count as many ribs (bones of the chest)
as possible. Observe Fig. 8.9 carefully
and compare with what you feel of the
chest bones. We see that the ribs are
curiously bent. They join the chest bone
and the backbone together to form a
box. This is called the rib cage. Some
important internal parts of our body lie
protected inside this cage.
Ask a friend to touch his toes without
bending his knees. Put
your fingers at the centre
of his back. Can you feel
some long and hard
structure? Starting from
the neck, move your
fingers downwards on the
back of your friend. What
you feel is his backbone.
It is made of many small
bones (Fig. 8.10). The rib
cage is joined to these
bones.

made up of only one long

BODY MOVEMENTS

Make your friend stand with his
hands pressed to a wall. Ask him to and
try to push the wall. Do you see two bones
standing where his shoulders are? They
are called shoulder bones (Fig 8.11).
Observe Fig. 8.12 carefully. This
structure is made of pelvic bones. They
enclose the portion of your body
below the stomach. This is the part
you sit on.

Fig. 8.12 Pelvic bones.

The skull is made of many bones
joined together (Fig. 8.13). It encloses
and protects a very important part of
the body, the brain.
We discussed the many bones and
the joints of our skeleton. There are

Fig. 8.13 The skull
71

some additional parts of the skeleton
that are not as hard as the bones and
which can be bent. These are called
cartilage.
Feel your ear. Do you find any hard
bony parts that can be bent
(Fig. 8.14)? There do not seem to be any
bones here, isn’t it? Do you notice
anything different between the ear lobe
and the portions above it (Fig. 8.15), as
you press them between your fingers?

(a)

(b)

Fig. 8.16 Two muscles work together to move
a bone

Fig. 8.14 Upper part of
ear has cartilage
Fig. 8.15 The ear lobe

You do feel something in the upper parts
of the ear that is not as soft as the ear
lobe but, not as hard as a bone, isn’t it?
This is cartilage. Cartilage is also found
in the joints of the body.
We have seen that our skeleton is
made up of many bones, joints and
cartilage. You could see, bend and move
many of them. Draw a neat figure of the
skeleton in your notebook.
We have learnt about the bones in our
body and about joints that help us move
in different ways. What makes the bones
move the way they do? Let us find out.
Make a fist with one hand, bend your
arm at the elbow and touch your
shoulder with the thumb (Fig. 8.16). Do
you see any change in your upper arm?
72

Touch it with the other hand. Do you
feel a swollen region inside your upper
arm? This is a muscle. The muscle
bulged due to contraction (it became
smaller in length). Now bring your arm
back to its normal position. What
happened to the muscle? Is it still
contracted? You can observe similar
contraction of muscles in your leg when
you walk or run.
When contracted, the muscle
becomes shorter, stiffer and thicker. It
pulls the bone.
Muscles work in pairs. When one of
them contracts, the bone is pulled in
that direction. The other muscle of the
pair relaxes. To move the bone in the
opposite direction, the relaxed musle
contracts to pull the bone towards its
original postion, while the first relaxes.
A muscle can only pull. It cannot push.
Thus, two muscles have to work together
to move a bone (Fig. 8.16).
Are muscles and bones always
required for movement? How do other
animals move? Do all animals have
SCIENCE

bones? What about an earthworm or a
snail? Let us study the manner of
movement, that is, the gait of some
animals.

8.2 “GAIT

OF

ANIMALS”

Earthworm
Activity 5
Observe an earthworm moving on soil
in a garden. Gently lift it and place it
on a piece of blotting or filter paper.
Observe its movement (Fig. 8.17). Then
place it on a smooth glass plate or any
slippery surface. Observe its movement
now. Is it different from that on paper?
Do you find that the earthworm is able
to move easily on a hard slippery
surface?
The body of an earthworm is made
up of many rings joined end to end. An

contractions, the earthworm can move
through soil. The body secretes a slimy
substance to help the movement.
How does it fix parts of its body to
the ground? Under its body, it has a
large number of tiny bristles (hair like
structures) projecting out. The bristles
are connected with muscles. The bristles
help to get a good grip on the ground.
The earthworm, actually, eats its way
through the soil! Its body then throws
away the undigested part of the material
that it eats. This activity of an earthworm
makes the soil more useful for plants.

Snail
Activity 6
Collect a snail from a garden. Have you
seen the rounded structure it carries on
its back (Fig. 8.18)?

Fig. 8.18 A snail
Fig. 8.17 Movement of earthworm

earthworm does not have bones. It has
muscles which help to extend and
shorten the body. During movement,
the earthworm first extends the front
part of the body, keeping the rear
portion fixed to the ground. Then it fixes
the front end and releases the rear end.
It then shortens the body and pulls the
rear end forward. This makes it move
forward by a small distance. Repeating
such muscle expansions and
BODY MOVEMENTS

This is called the shell and it is the
outer skeleton of the snail, but is not
made of bones. The shell is a single unit
and does not help in moving from place
to place. It has to be dragged along.
Place the snail on a glass plate and
watch it. When it starts moving,
carefully lift the glass plate along with
the snail over your head. Observe its
movements from beneath.
A thick structure and the head of the
snail may come out of an opening in
73

the shell. The thick structure is its foot,
made of strong muscles. Now, carefully
tilt the glass plate. The wavy motion of
the foot can be seen. Is the movement of
a snail slow or fast as compared to an
earthworm?

Cockroach
Activity 7
Observe a cockroach (Fig. 8.19).
Cockroaches walk and climb as well
as fly in the air. They have three pairs
of legs. These help in walking. The body
is covered with a hard outer skeleton.
This outer skeleton is made of different

Fig. 8.20 Skeleton of a bird

bony parts of the forelimbs are modified
as wings. The shoulder bones are strong.
The breastbones are modified to hold
muscles of flight which are used to move
the wings up and down (Fig. 8.20).

Fish
Activity 8
Fig. 8.19 A cockroach

units joined together and that permits
movement.
There are two pairs of wings attached
to the breast. The cockroaches have
distinct muscles — those near the legs
move the legs for walking. The breast
muscles move the wings when the
cockroach flies.

Make a paper boat. Put it in water and
push it with one narrow end pointing
forward [Fig. 8.21 (a)]. Did it go into the
water easily? Now hold the boat
sideways and push it into the water
from the broad side [Fig. 8.21 (b)]. Are
you able to make the boat move in water
when you push it from this side?

Birds
Birds fly in the air and walk on the
ground. Some birds like ducks and
swans also swim in water. The birds can
fly because their bodies are well suited
for flying. Their bones are hallow and
light. The bones of the hind limbs are
typical for walking and perching. The

Fish also have other fins on their
body which mainly help to keep the
balance of the body and to keep
direction, while swimming. Did you ever
notice that under water divers wear fin
like flippers on their feet, to help them
move easily in water?
Fig. 8.22 Fish

How do snakes move?

Have you noticed that the shape of a
boat is somewhat like a fish (Fig 8.22)?
The head and tail of the fish are smaller
than the middle portion of the body –
the body tapers at both ends. This body
shape is called streamlined.
The shape is such that water can flow
around it easily and allow the fish to
move in water.The skeleton of the fish
is covered with strong muscles. During
swimming, muscles make the front part
of the body curve to one side and the
tail part swings towards the opposite
side. The fish forms a curve as shown
in Fig. 8.23. Then, quickly, the body and
tail curve to the other side. This makes
a jerk and pushes the body forward. A
series of such jerks make the fish swim
ahead. This is helped by the fins of
the tail.

Have you seen a snake slither? Does it
move straight(Fig. 8.24)?
Snakes have a long backbone. They
have many thin muscles. They are
connected to each other even though they
are far from one another. They also
interconnect the backbone, ribs and skin.
The snake’s body curves into many
loops. Each loop of the snake gives it a
forward push by pressing against the
ground. Since its long body makes
many loops and each loop gives it this
push, the snake moves forward very fast
and not in a straightline.
We have learned about the use of
bones and muscles for the movements
of different animals. Paheli and Boojho
have many questions in their sacks
about the different movements in
animals. So must you be having many
unanswered questions buzzing in your

Fig. 8.23 Movement in Fish

75

minds? The ancient Greek philosopher
Aristotle, in his book Gait of Animals,
asked himself these questions. Why do
different animals have the body parts
that they do have and how do these
body parts help animals to move the
way they do? What are the similarities
and differences in these body parts
between different animals? How many
body parts are needed by different
animals for moving from place to

76

place? Why two legs for humans and
four for cows and buffaloes? Many
animals seem to be having an even
number of legs, why? Why is the
bending of our legs different from that
of our arms?
So many questions and perhaps
we have looked for some answers
through our activities in this chapter
and we need to look for many
more answers.

Bones and cartilage form the skeleton of the human body. It gives the
frame and shape to the body and helps in movement. It protects the
inner organs.
The skeleton comprises the skull, the back bone, ribs and the breast
bone, shoulder and hipbones, and the bones of hands and legs.
The bones are moved by alternate contractions and relaxations of two
sets of muscles.
The bone joints are of various kinds depending on the nature of joints
and direction of movement they allow.
Strong muscles and light bones work together to help the birds fly. They
fly by flapping their wings.
Fish swim by forming loops alternately on two sides of the body.
Snakes slither on the ground by looping sideways. A large number of
bones and associated muscles push the body forward.
The body and legs of cockroaches have hard coverings forming an outer
skeleton. The muscles of the breast connected with three pairs of legs
and two pairs of wings help the cockroach to walk and fly.
Earthworms move by alternate extension and contraction of the body
using muscles. Tiny bristles on the underside of the body help in gripping
the ground.
Snails move with the help of a muscular foot.

THINGS TO THINK ABOUT
We discussed the many movements our bodies are capable of. Healthy bones,
muscles, joints and cartilages are needed by the body for all these movements.
Some of us suffer from conditions that could make these movements not so easy. In
a whole class activity, try to find ways that one would manage everyday activities, if
any one of our body movements was not possible. In Activity 1, for instance, you
tied a scale on your arm and disabled the elbow movement. Think of other ways of
restricting normal body movements and find ways that everyday activities could
then be managed.

The Living Organisms and
Their Surroundings

aheli and Boojho went on
vacation to many places of
interest. One such trip took
them to the river Ganga in Rishikesh.
They climbed the mountains of the
Himalayas, where it was very cold. They
saw many kinds of trees on these
mountains — oaks, pines and deodars,
very different from the ones near their
home on the plains! In yet another trip,
they travelled to Rajasthan and moved
on camels through the hot desert. They
collected different kinds of cactus plants
from this trip. Finally, they went on a
trip to Puri and visited the sea beach,
dotted with casuarina trees. While
recollecting all the fun that they had on
these trips, a thought struck them. All
these places were so different from one
another, some were cold, some very hot
and dry, and some places so humid. And
yet all of them had many organisms
(living creatures) of various kinds.
They tried to think of a place on Earth
where there may not be any living
creatures. Boojho thought of places near
his home. Inside the house, he tried the
cupboards. He had thought that there
may not be any living organisms here,
but he found one tiny spider in the
cupboard. Outside the home too, there
did not seem to be any place, he could
think of, that did not have living creatures

of some kind or the other (Fig. 9.1). Paheli
started thinking and reading about far
away places. She read that people have
even found tiny living organisms in the
openings of volcanoes!

Fig. 9.1 Search for living organisms

9.1 ORGANISMS AND THE
SURROUNDINGS WHERE THEY LIVE
Another thought that occurred to Paheli
and Boojho was about the kinds of living
organisms that were present in different
locations that they had visited. The
deserts had camels, the mountains had
goats and yak. Puri had some other
creatures — crabs on the beach and
such a variety of fish being caught by
the fishermen at the sea! And then,
there did seem to be some creatures like
ants that were present in all these
different locations. The kinds of plants
found in each of these regions were so
different from the plants of the other
regions. What about the surroundings

in these different regions? Were they
the same?

will discuss the table as we travel
through many more interesting places.

Activity 1

9.2 HABITAT AND ADAPTATION

Let us start with a forest. Think of all
the plants, animals and objects that can
be found there. List them in Column 1
of Table 9.1. List things, animals and
plants, found in the other regions that
are also shown in the table. You can
collect the examples scattered through
this chapter to fill Table 9.1. Discuss
also with your friends, parents and
teachers, to find more examples to fill
the tables. You can also consult many
interesting books in libraries that talk
of animals, plants and minerals of
different regions.
T ry and include many plants,
animals and objects, big and small, in
each of the columns in this table. What
kind of objects will we find that may not
be animals or plants? Perhaps parts of
plants like dried leaves, or parts of
animals, like bones. We may also find
different kinds of soils and pebbles.
Water in the oceans may have salts
dissolved in it as discussed in Chapter
5. There could be many more objects.
As we go through the chapter, keep
adding more examples to Table 9.1. We

What do you find from the plants and
animals listed in Activity 1? Did you find
a large variety in them? Look at what you
have entered in the column for the desert
and the column for the sea in Table 9.1.
Did you list very different kind of
organisms in these two columns?
What are the surroundings like, in
these two regions?
In the sea, plants and animals are
surrounded by saline (salty) water. Most
of them use the air dissolved in water.
There is very little water available in
the desert. It is very hot in the day time
and very cold at night in the desert. The
animals and plants of the desert live on
the desert soil and breathe air from the
surroundings.
The sea and the desert are very
different surroundings and we find very
different kind of plants and animals in
these two regions, isn’t it? Let us look
at two very different kinds of organisms
from the desert and the sea – a camel
and a fish. The body structure of a camel
helps it to survive in desert conditions.
Camels have long legs which help to

keep their bodies away from the heat of
the sand (Fig. 9.2). They excrete small
amount of urine, their dung is dry and
they do not sweat. Since camels lose
very little water from their bodies, they
can live for many days without water.
Let us look at different kinds of fish.
Some of these are shown in Fig. 9.3.
There are so many kinds of fish, but, do
you see that they all have something
common about their shape? All the ones
shown here have the streamlined shape
that was discussed in Chapter 8. This
shape helps them move inside water.
Fish have slippery scales on their bodies.
These scales protect the fish and also
help in easy movement through water.
We discussed in Chapter 8, that fish
have flat fins and tails that help them
to change directions and keep their body
balance in water. Gills present in the
fish help them to use oxygen dissolved
in water.
We see that the features of a fish help
it to live inside water and the features of
a camel help it to survive in a desert.

Fig. 9.2 Camels in their surroundings
THE LIVING ORGANISMS AND THEIR SURROUNDINGS

We have taken only two examples
from a very wide variety of animals and
plants that live on the Earth. In all this
variety of organisms, we will find that
they have certain features that help
them live in the surroundings in which
they are normally found. The presence
of specific features or certain habits,
which enable a plant or an animal to
live in its surroundings, is called
adaptation. Different animals are
adapted to their surroundings in
different ways.
The surroundings where organisms
live is called a habitat. The organisms
depend for their food, water, air, shelter
and other needs on their habitat.
Habitat means a dwelling place (a
home). Several kinds of plants and
animals may share the same habitat.
The plants and animals that live on
land are said to live in terrestrial
habitats. Some examples of terrestrial
habitats are forests, grasslands, deserts,
coastal and mountain regions. On the
other hand, the habitats of plants and

of time to help them adjust to some changes in their surroundings. For instance,
if we live in the plains and suddenly go to high mountain regions, we may
experience difficulty in breathing and doing physical exercise for some days.
We need to breathe faster when we are on high mountains. After some days,
our body adjusts to the changed conditions on the high mountain. Such
small changes that take place in the body of a single organism over short
periods, to overcome small problems due to changes in the surroundings, are
called acclimatisation. These changes are different from the adaptations that
take place over thousands of years.
animals that live in water are called
aquatic habitats. Ponds, swamps,
lakes, rivers and oceans are some
examples of aquatic habitats. There are
large variations in forests, grasslands,
deserts, coastal and mountain regions
located in different parts of the world.
This is true for all aquatic habitats
as well.
The living things such as plants
and animals, in a habitat, are its biotic
components. Various non-living things
such as rocks, soil, air and water in
the habitat constitute its abiotic
components. Sunlight and heat
also form abiotic components of
the habitat.
We know that some plants grow from
seeds. Let us look at some abiotic factors
and their effect on seeds as they grow
into young plants.

Activity 2
Recall Activity 5 in Chapter 1 — we made
sprouts from moong and chana seeds.
When the seed turned into a sprout, it
germinated. This was the beginning of
a new plant, from the seed.
82

Collect some dry moong seeds. Keep
a small heap of seeds aside and soak
the rest in water for a day. Divide the
soaked seeds into four parts. Keep one
part completely submerged in water for
3-4 days. Do not disturb the dry seeds
and those submerged in water. Keep one
part of soaked seeds in a sunny room
and another in a completely dark
region like a cupboard that does not
allow any light to come in. Keep the last
part in very cold surroundings, say, in
a refrigerator or with ice around them.
Set these three parts to germinate by
rinsing them and draining the water
every day. What do you notice, after a
few days? Do the seeds in all the five
parts germinate equally? Do you find
slower or no germination in any
of these?
Do you find that abiotic factors like
air, water, light and heat are very
important for growth of plants. In fact,
these abiotic factors are important for
all living organisms.
We find that organisms exist in very
cold as well as very hot climates and
surroundings, isn’t it? How do they
SCIENCE

manage to survive? That is where,
adaptation comes in.
Adaptation does not take place in a
short time. Over thousands of years, the
abiotic factors of a region change. Those
animals which cannot adapt to these
changes die out, and only the adapted
ones survive. Animals adapt to different
abiotic factors in different ways. The
result is variety of organisms present in
different habitats.
Let us look at some habitats, the
abiotic factors of these, and the
adaptations of animals to these habitats.

Fig. 9.4 Desert animals in burrows

9.3 A JOURNEY THROUGH DIFFERENT
HABITATS
Some Terrestrial Habitats
Deserts
We discussed the abiotic factors of a
desert and the adaptations in camels
to these. What about other animals
and plants that are found in deserts?
Do they have the same kind of
adaptations?
There are desert animals like rats
and snakes, which do not have the long
legs that the camel has. To stay away
from the intense heat during the day,
they stay in burrows deep in the sand
(Fig 9.4). These animals come out only
during the night, when it is cooler.
Fig. 9.5 shows some typical plants
that grow in a desert. How are these
adapted to the desert?

Activity 3
Bring a potted cactus and a leafy plant
to the classroom. Tie polythene bags to
THE LIVING ORGANISMS AND THEIR SURROUNDINGS

Fig. 9.5 Some typical plants that grow in desert

some parts of the two plants, as was
done for Activity 4 in Chapter 7, where
we studied transpiration in plants.
Leave the potted plants in the sun and
observe after a few hours. What do you
see? Do you notice any difference in the
amount of water collected on the two
polythene bags?
Desert plants lose very little water
through transpiration. The leaves in
desert plants are either absent, very
small, or they are present in the shape
of spines. This helps in reducing loss of
water from the leaves through
transpiration. The leaf-like structure
you see in a cactus is, in fact, its stem
(Fig. 9.5). Photosynthesis in these plants
83

is usually carried out by the stems. The
stem is also covered with a thick waxy
layer, which helps to retain water. Most
desert plants have roots that go very
deep into the soil for absorbing water.
Mountain regions
These habitats are normally very cold
and windy. In some areas, snowfall may
take place in winters.
There is a large variety of plants and
animals living in the mountain regions.
Have you seen the kind of trees shown
in Fig. 9.6?

also present on mountains. They may
have different kind of adaptations to
survive on the mountains.
Animals living in the mountain regions
are also adapted to the conditions there
(Fig. 9.7). They have thick skin or fur to
protect them from cold. For example, yaks
have long hair to keep them warm. Snow
leopard has thick fur on its body

(a)

Fig. 9.6 Trees of a mountain habitat

If you live in a mountain region or
have visited one, you may have seen a
large number of such trees. But, have
you ever noticed such trees naturally
growing in other regions?
How are these trees adapted to the
conditions prevailing in their habitat?
These trees are normally cone shaped
and have sloping branches. The leaves
of some of these trees are needle-like.
This helps the rainwater and snow to
slide off easily. There could be trees with
shapes very different from these that are
84

(b)

Fig. 9.7 (a) Snow
leopards, (b) yak
and (c) mountain

SCIENCE

including feet and toes. This protects its
feet from the cold when it walks on the
snow. The mountain goat has strong
hooves for running up the rocky slopes
of the mountains.
As we go up in the mountainous
regions, the surroundings change and
we see different kinds of adaptations at
different heights.
Grasslands
A lion lives in a forest or a grassland
and is a strong animal that can hunt
and kill animals like deer. It is light
brown in colour. Look at the picture of
a lion and that of a deer (Fig. 9.8). How
are the eyes placed in the face for these
two animals? Are they in the front or
on the side of the face? Lions have long
claws in their front legs that can be
withdrawn inside the toes. Do the
features of a lion help it in any way to

survive? It’s light brown colour helps it
to hide in dry grasslands when it hunts
for prey (animals to eat). The eyes in
front of the face allow it to have a correct
idea about the location of its prey.
A deer is another animal that lives in
forests and grasslands. It has strong teeth
for chewing hard plant stems of the
forest. A deer needs to know about the
presence of predators ( animals like lion
that make it their prey ) in order to run
away from them and not become their
prey. It has long ears to hear movements
of predators. The eyes on the side of its
head allow it to look in all directions for
danger. The speed of the deer helps them
to run away from the predators.
There are many other features of a
lion, a deer or other animals and plants
that help them to survive in their
habitat.

THE LIVING ORGANISMS AND THEIR SURROUNDINGS

Oceans
We already discussed how fish are
adapted to live in the sea. Many other
sea animals have streamlined bodies to
help them move easily in water. There
are some sea animals like squids and
octopus, which do not have this
streamlined shape. They stay deeper in
the ocean, near the seabed and catch
any prey that moves towards them.
However, when they move in water they
make their body shapes streamlined.
These animals have gills to help them
use oxygen dissolved in water.
There are some sea animals like
dolphins and whales that do not have
85

gills. They breathe in air through
nostrils or blowholes that are located
on the upper parts of their heads. This
allows them to breathe in air when they
swim near the surface of water. They can
stay inside the water for a long time
without breathing. They come out to the
surface from time to time, to breathe in
air. Did you ever see this interesting
activity of dolphins in television
programme or films on ocean life?
Ponds and lakes
Have you seen plants growing in ponds,
lakes, rivers and even some drains? Go
on a field trip to a nearby pond, if possible,
and try to draw the kinds of plants that
are seen there. How are the leaves, stems
and roots of these plants placed?
Some of these plants have their roots
fixed in the soil below the water
(Fig. 9.9). In terrestrial plants, roots
normally play a very important role in the

Fig. 9.9 Some aquatic plants float on water.
Some have their roots fixed in the soil at the
bottom. Some aquatic plants are compltely
submerged in water.
86

absorption of nutrients and water from
the soil. However, in aquatic plants, roots
are much reduced in size and their main
function is to hold the plant in place.
The stems of these plants are long,
hollow and light. The stems grow up to
the surface of water while the leaves and
flowers, float on the surface of the water.
Some aquatic plants are totally
submerged in water. All parts of such
plants grow under water. Some of these
plants have narrow and thin ribbon-like
leaves. These can bend in the flowing
water. In some submerged plants, leaves
are often highly divided, through which
the water can easily flow without
damaging them.
Frogs usually have ponds as their
habitat. Frogs can stay both inside the
pond water as well as move on land.
They have strong back legs that help
them in leaping and catching their prey.
They have webbed feet which help them
swim in water.
We have discussed only a few
common animals and plants compared
to the wide variety that live in the
different habitats. You may have also
noticed the very wide variety in plants
around you, when you prepared a
herbarium as part of the suggested
activities in Chapter 7. Imagine the kind
of variety that you could see in a
herbarium of leaves of plants from all
regions of the Earth!

9.4 LIVING THINGS AROUND

US

We went on a journey through different
habitats and discussed many plants and
SCIENCE

animals. In Activity 1, we listed objects,
plants and animals found in different
surroundings. Suppose we stop a while
and think which examples in our list
are living? Let us think of examples from
a forest. Trees, creepers, small and big
animals, birds, snakes, insects, rocks,
soil, water, air, dry leaves, dead animals,
mushrooms and moss may be only some
of the objects that are present in the
forest. Which of these are living?
Think of objects that you can see
around you at this moment and group
them as living and non-living. In some
cases, it is easy for us to know. For
example, objects like chair or a table in
our homes we know that they are not
alive. Paheli was reading this rhyme
from Complete Nonsense written by
Edward Lear:

THE LIVING ORGANISMS AND THEIR SURROUNDINGS

Paheli and Boojho found the poem
so very funny, because they knew that
a chair or a table is not alive and it
cannot talk, walk or suffer from the
usual problems that all of us face.
A chair, table, stone or a coin. We
know that they are not alive. Similarly,
we do know that we are alive and so are
all the people of the world. We also see
animals around us that are so full of
life — dogs, cats, monkeys, squirrels,
insects and many others.
How do we know that something is
living? Often, it is not so easy to decide.
We are told that plants are living things,
but they do not appear to move like a
dog or a pigeon. On the other hand, a
car or a bus can move, still we consider
them as non-living. Plants and animals
appear to grow in size with time. But
then, at times, clouds in the sky also
seem to grow in size. Does it mean that
clouds are living? No! So, how does one
distinguish between living and nonliving things? Do living things have
some common characteristics that
make them very different from the
non-living?
You are a wonderful example of a living
being. What characteristics do you have
which make you different from a nonliving thing? List a few of these
characteristics in your notebook. Look at
your list and mark those characteristics
that you have listed, which may also be
found in animals or plants.
Some of these characteristics are
perhaps common to all living things.
87

Do all living things need food?
In Chapters 1 and 2, we learnt that all
living things need food and how
essential it is to animals and to us. We
have also learnt that plants make their
own food through the process of
photosynthesis. Animals depend on
plants and other animals for their food.
Food gives organisms the energy
needed for them to grow. Organisms also
need this energy for other life processes
that go on inside them.

Do all living things show
growth?
Does the kurta you had four years back,
still fit you? You cannot wear it any
more, isn’t it? You must have grown
taller during these years. You may not
realise it, but you are growing all the
time and in few more years you will
become an adult. (Fig 9.10).
Young ones of animals also grow into
adults. You would surely have noticed

Fig. 9.10 A baby grows into an adult
88

pups of a dog grow
into adults. A
chicken hatched
from an egg, grows
into a hen or a cock.
(Fig 9.11).
Plants also grow.
Look around you
and see a few plants
of a particular type.
Some are very small
and young, some Fig. 9.11 A chicken
are grown. They grows into an adult
may all be in different stages of growth.
Look at the plants after a few days and
weeks. You may find that some of them
have grown in size. Growth seems to be
common to all living things.
Do you think, non-living things
cannot show growth?

Do all living things respire?
Can we live without breathing? When
we inhale, the air moves from outside to
the inside of the body. When we breathe
out, the air moves from inside our body
to outside. Breathing is part of a process
called respiration. In respiration, some
of the oxygen of the air we breathe in, is
used by the living body. We breathe
out the carbon dioxide produced in this
process.
The process of breathing in animals
like cows, buffaloes, dogs or cats is
similar to humans. Observe any one of
these animals while they are taking rest,
and notice the movement of their
abdomen. This slow movement indicates
that they are breathing.
SCIENCE

Respiration is necessary for all living
organisms. It is through respiration that
the body finally obtains energy from the
food it takes.
Some animals may have different
mechanisms for the exchange of gases,
which is a part of the respiration process.
For example, earthworms breathe
through their skin. Fish, we have learnt,
have gills for using oxygen dissolved in
water. The gills absorb oxygen from the
air dissolved in water.
Do plants also respire? Exchange of
gases in plants mainly takes place
through their leaves. The leaves take in
air through tiny pores in them and use
the oxygen. They give out carbon
dioxide to the air.
We learnt that in sunlight, plants
use carbon dioxide of air to produce
their own food and give out oxygen.
Plants produce their food only during
the daytime whereas respiration in
them takes place day and night. The
amount of oxygen released in the
process of food preparation by plants
is much more than the oxygen they use
in respiration.

Do all living things respond to
stimuli?
How do you respond, if you suddenly
step on a sharp object like a thorn, while
walking barefoot? How do you feel when
you see or think about your favourite
food? You suddenly move from a dark
place into bright sunlight. What
happens? Your eyes shut themselves
automatically for a moment till
THE LIVING ORGANISMS AND THEIR SURROUNDINGS

they adjust to the changed bright
surroundings. Your favourite food,
bright light and a thorn, in the above
situations are some examples of changes
in your surroundings. All of us respond
immediately to such changes. Changes
in our surroundings that makes us
respond to them, are called stimuli.
Do other animals also respond to
stimuli? Observe the behaviour of
animals, when the food is served to
them. Do you find them suddenly
becoming active on seeing the food?
When you move towards a bird, what
does it do? Wild animals run away when
bright light is flashed towards them.
Similarly, cockroaches begin to move to
their hiding places if the light in the
kitchen is switched on at night. Can you
give some more examples of responses
of animals to stimuli?
Do plants also respond to stimuli?
Flowers of some plants bloom only at
night. In some plants flowers close after
sunset. In some plants like mimosa,
commonly known as ‘touch-me-not’,
leaves close or fold when someone
touches them. These are some examples
of responses of plants towards changes
in their surroundings.

Activity 4
Place a potted plant in a room a little
away from a window through which
sunlight enters some time during the
day (Fig. 9.12). Continue watering the
plant for a few days. Does the plant grow
upright, like plants out in the open?
Note the direction in which it bends, if
89

Do all living things
reproduce their
own kind?
Have you ever seen nests
of some birds like
pigeons? Many birds lay
their eggs in the nest. Some of the eggs
may hatch and young birds come out
of these (Fig. 9.13).
Fig. 9.12 Plant respond to light

it is not growing upright. Do you think,
this may be in response to some
stimulus?
All living things respond to changes
around them.

Living organisms and excretion
All living things take food. Not all the
food that is eaten is really used, only a
part of it is utilised by the body. What
happens to the rest? This has to be
removed by the body as wastes. Our body
also produces some wastes in other life
processes. The process of getting rid of
these wastes by the living organisms is
known as excretion.
Do plants also excrete? Yes, they do.
However, the mechanisms in plants are a
little different. Some harmful or poisonous
materials do get produced in plants as
wastes. Some plants find it possible to
store the waste products within their
parts in a way that they do not harm the
plant as a whole. Some plants remove
waste products as secretions.
Excretion is another characteristics
common to all living things.
90

Animals reproduce their own kind.
The mode of reproduction may be
different, in different animals. Some
animals produce their young ones
through eggs. Some animals give birth
to the young ones (Fig. 9.14).
Plants also reproduce. Like animals,
plants also differ in their mode of
reproduction. Many plants reproduce
through seeds. Plants produce seeds,

Fig. 9.14 Some animals which give birth to
their young ones
SCIENCE

Living things produce more of their
own kind through reproduction. It
takes place in many different ways, for
different organisms.

Do all living things move?
Fig. 9.15 A seed from a plant germinates into a
new plant

which can germinate and grow into new
plants (Fig.9.15).
Some plants also reproduce through
parts other than seeds. For example, a
part of a potato with a bud, grows into a
new plant (Fig 9.16).

Fig. 9.16 A new plant grows from a bud of potato

Plants also reproduce through
cuttings. Would you like to grow a plant
in this way yourself?

Activity 5
Take a cutting from a rose or a menhdi
plant. Fix it in the soil and water it
regularly. What do you observe, after a
few days?
It may not be easy to grow plants from
cuttings. Do not be disappointed if your
cutting does not grow. Talk to a gardner,
if possible, on the care to be given to
cuttings to make them grow into plants.
THE LIVING ORGANISMS AND THEIR SURROUNDINGS

In Chapter 8, we discussed the various
ways in which animals move. They move
from one place to another and also show
other body movements.
What about plants? Do they also
move? Plants are generally anchored in
soil so they do not move from one place
to another. However, various substances
like water, minerals and the food
synthesised by them moves from one
part of the plant to other. Have you
noticed any other kind of movement in
plants? Opening or closing of flowers?
Do you recall how some plants show
movement in response to certain
stimuli?
We also have some non-living
things moving, of course. A bus, car, a
small piece of paper, clouds and so on.
Is there something different in these
movements from the movements of
living beings?
There is such a variety of living
organisms, but, all of them show some
common characteristics, as we have
discussed. Yet another common
characteristic is that living beings die.
Because organisms die, organism types
can survive over thousands of years only
if they reproduce their own kind. One
single organism may die without ever
reproducing, but, the type of organism
can exist only if there is reproduction.
91

We see that, all living things seem to
have some common characteristics.
They all need food, respire, respond to
stimuli, reproduce, show movement,
grow and die.
Do we find some non-living things that
also show some of these characteristics?
Cars, bicycle, clocks and the water in
the river move. The moon moves in the
sky. A cloud grows in size right in front
of our eyes. Can such things be called
living? We ask ourselves, do these objects
also show all the other characteristics
of living things?
In general, something that is living
may have all the characteristics that we
have discussed, while non-living things
may not show all these characteristics
at the same time.
Is this always true? Do we always find
that living things definitely show all the
characteristics of the living that we have
discussed? Do we always find that nonliving things may show only some of these
characteristics and never all of them?
To understand this a little better, let
us look at a specific example. Consider
any seed, say, moong. Is it living? It can

92

stay in a shop for months and not show
any growth or some of the other
characteristics of life. However, we bring
the same seed and plant it in soil, water
it and it turns into a whole plant. Did
the seed — need food, did it excrete,
grow or reproduce when it was in the
shop for many months?
We see that there can be cases when
we cannot easily say that a thing has all
the characteristics that we have discussed,
for it to be called living.

“What then is life?”
Push your hand deep inside a sack of
wheat. Do you find it is warm inside?
There is some heat being produced
inside the sack of wheat. The seeds
respire and in that process give out
some heat.
We see that respiration is a process
that takes place in seeds even when
some of the other life processes may not
be very active.
It may not be very easy to answer
our question — “what then is life”?
However, looking at all the diversity of
living beings around us, we can
conclude that “life is beautiful”!

The surroundings where plants and animals live, is called their habitat.
Several kinds of plants and animals may share the same habitat.
The presence of specific features and habits, which enable a plant or an
animal to live in a particular habitat, is called adaptation.
There are many types of habitats, however, these may be broadly grouped
as terrestrial (on the land) and aquatic (in water).
There is a wide variety of organisms present in different habitats.
Plants, animals and microorganisms together constitute biotic
components.
Rocks, soil, air, water, light and temperature are some of the abiotic
components of our surroundings.
Living things have certain common characteristics — they need food,
they respire and, excrete, respond to their environment, reproduce, grow
and show movement.

here was a general discussion
among the children in Paheli and
Boojho's class about the places
they had visited during the summer
vacations. Someone had gone to their
native village by a train, then a bus, and
finally a bullock cart. One student had
travelled by an aeroplane. Another spent
many days of his holidays going on
fishing trips in his uncle's boat.
The teacher then asked them to read
newspaper articles that mentioned
about small wheeled vehicles that moved
on the soil of Mars and conducted
experiments. These vehicles were taken
by spacecraft all the way to Mars!
Meanwhile, Paheli had been reading
stories about ancient India and wanted
to know how people travelled from one
place to another in earlier times.

10.1 STORY

OF

imitated the shapes of the animals living
in water. Recall our discussions of this
streamlined shape of fish in Chapters
8 and 9.
Invention of the wheel made a great
change in modes of transport. The
design of the wheel was improved over
thousands of years. Animals were used
to pull vehicles that moved on wheels.
Until the beginning of the 19th
century, people still depended on
animal power to transport them from
place to place. The invention of steam
engine introduced a new source of
power. Railroads were made for steam
engine driven carriages and wagons.

TRANSPORT

Long ago people did not have any means
of transport. They used to move only on
foot and carry goods either on their back
or using animals.
For transport along water routes,
boats were used from ancient times. To
begin with, boats were simple logs of
wood in which a hollow cavity could be
made. Later, people learnt to put
together different pieces of wood and
give shapes to the boats. These shapes

Fig 10.1 Means of transportation

Later came automobiles. Motorised boats
and ships were used as means of transport
on water. The early years of 1900 saw the
development of aeroplanes. These were
later improved to carry passengers and
goods. Electric trains, monorail,
supersonic aeroplanes and spacecraft are
some of the 20th century contributions.
Fig. 10.1 shows some of the different
modes of transport. Place them in the
correct order — from the earliest modes
of transport to the most recent.
Are there any of the early modes of
transport that are not in use today?

10.2 HOW FAR HAVE YOU TRAVELLED?
HOW WIDE IS THIS DESK?
How did people know how far they have
travelled?
How will you know whether you can
walk all the way to your school or whether
you will need to take a bus or a rickshaw
to reach your school? When you need to
purchase something, is it possible for you
to walk to the market? How will you know
the answers to these questions?
It is often important to know how far
a place is, so that we can have an idea
how we are going to reach that place —
walk, take a bus or a train, a ship, an
aeroplane or even a spacecraft!
Sometimes, there are objects whose
length or width we need to know.
In Paheli and Boojho's classroom,
there are large desks which are to be
shared by two students. Paheli and
Boojho share one desk, but, frequently
end up fighting that the other is using
a larger share of the desk.
96

On the teacher's suggestion, they
decided to measure the length of the
desk, make a mark exactly in the middle
of it and draw a line to separate the two
halves of the desk.
Both of them are very fond of
playing gilli danda with their friends.
Boojho brought a set of gilli and danda
with him.
Here is how they tried to measure
the length of the desk using the danda
and the gilli (Fig. 10.2).
The desk seems to be having a
length equal to two danda lengths and
two lengths of the gilli. Drawing a line
in the middle of the desk leaves each
of them happy with a half of the desk
equal to a danda and a gilli in length.
After a few days, the marked line gets
wiped out. Boojho now has a new set
of gilli and danda as he lost his old
one. Here is how, the length of the
desk seems to measure using the gilli
and danda (Fig. 10.3).

Fig. 10.2 Measuring the length of a desk with
gilli and danda

Fig. 10.3 Measuring the length of the desk with
a different set of gilli and danda
SCIENCE

Hello! Now, when measured with the
new set of gilli and danda, the desk
length seems to be about two danda
lengths, one gilli length with a small
length still left out. This is less than one
gilli length. Now what?
What would you suggest Paheli and
Boojho do, to measure the length of the
whole desk? Can they use a cricket
wicket and bails to measure the length
or do you think that this might create
the similar problem?
One thing they could do is to take a
small length of string and mark two points
on it. This will be a string length. They
can measure the width of the desk in
string lengths (Fig. 10.4). How can they
use the string to measure distances less
than the length of a string? They can fold
the string and mark it into

1
2

,

1
4

and

1

'string lengths'. Now, perhaps Paheli and
Boojho can measure the exact length of
the desk using the string.
You would say that they should use
the scale in their geometry box and solve
their problem? Yes, Of course!
Boojho has been reading about the
way people used to measure distances

before such standard scales were made
and he has been trying to follow different
methods of measuring distances.
There are so many occasions when we
come across a need to measure lengths
and distances. The tailor needs to measure
the length of the cloth to know if it is
enough to stitch a kurta. A carpenter
needs to measure the height and width
of a cupboard to know how much wood
he would need to make its door. The
farmer needs to know the length and
breadth or the area of his land to know
how much seed he can sow and how
much water would be needed for his crops.
Suppose, you are asked how tall you
are? You want to tell the length of a
straight line from the top of your head
to the heel of your feet.
How long is this broom?
How wide is this desk?
How far is it from Delhi to Lucknow?
How far away is the Moon from the
Earth?
All these questions have one thing
in common. They all concern distance
between two places. The two places may
be close enough, like the two ends of a
table or they may be far apart, like
Jammu and Kanyakumari.
Let us do a few measurements to see
what exactly we need to do, when we
measure distances or lengths.

10.3 SOME MEASUREMENTS
Activity 1
Fig. 10.4 Measuring the length of the desk with
string lengths
MOTION AND MEASUREMENT OF DISTANCES

Work in groups and each of you do this
activity one by one. Using your foot as a
97

unit of length, measure the length and
breadth of the classroom. It is possible
that while measuring these you may find
some part remains to be measured as it
is smaller than your foot. Use a string
to measure the length of a part of your
foot as you did before. Record your
observations in Table 10.1.
Table 10.1 Measuring length and
breadth of classroom
Name of
student

Length of the
classroom

Width of the
classroom

Activity 2
Work in a group and each of you use
your handspan as a unit to measure
the width of a table or a desk in the
classroom (Fig. 10.5).

Fig. 10.5 Measuring the width of a table with a
handspan

Here too, you may find that you
need string lengths equal to your
handspan and then fractions of
this string length to make the
measurement. Record all observations
in Table 10.2.
We see that, measurement means the
comparison of an unknown quantity
98

Table 10.2 Measuring width of a table
Who measured the
width of the table?

Number of
handspans

with some known quantity. This known
fixed quantity is called a unit. The result
of a measurement is expressed in two
parts. One part is a number. The other
part is the unit of the measurement. For
example, if in Activity 1, the length of
the room is found to be 12 lengths of
your foot, then 12 is the number and
'foot length' is the unit selected for the
measurement.
Now, study all the measurements
recorded in Table 10.1 and 10.2. Are all
the measurements for the room using
everybody's foot, equal? Are everybody's
measurement, by handspan, of the
width of the table equal? Perhaps the
results could be different as the length
of your handspan and that of your
friends may not be the same. Similarly,
the length of the foot may be slightly
different for all the students. Therefore,
when you tell your measurement using
your handspan or length of foot as a
unit to others, they will not be able to
understand how big the actual length
is, unless they know the length of your
handspan or foot.
We see therefore, that some standard
units of measurement are needed, that
do not change from person to person.
SCIENCE

10.4 STANDARD UNITS
MEASUREMENTS

OF

In ancient times, the length of a foot,
the width of a finger, and the distance
of a step were commonly used as
different units of measurements.
The people of the Indus valley
civilisation must have used very good
measurements of length because we see
evidence in excavations of perfectly
geometrical constructions.
A cubit as the length from the elbow
to the finger tips was used in ancient
Egypt and was also accepted as a unit
of length in other parts of the world.
People also used the "foot" as a unit
of length in different parts of the world.
The length of the foot used varied
slightly from region to region.
People measured a yard of cloth by
the distance between the end of the
outstretched arm and their chin. The
Romans measured with their pace
or steps.
In ancient India, small length
measurements used were an angul
(finger) or a mutthi (fist). Even today, we
can see flower sellers using their forearm
as a unit of length for garlands in many
towns of India. Many such body parts
continue to be in use as unit of length,
when convenient.
However, everyone's body parts could
be of slightly different sizes. This must

have caused confusion in measurement.
In 1790, the French created a standard
unit of measurement called the
metric system.
For the sake of uniformity, scientists
all over the world have accepted a set of
standard units of measurement. The
system of units now used is known as
the International System of Units (SI
units). The SI unit of length is a metre.
A metre scale is shown in Fig.10.6. Also
shown is the 15 cm scale in your
geometry box.
Each metre (m) is divided into 100
equal divisions, called centimetre (cm).
Each centimetre has ten equal divisions,
called millimetre (mm). Thus,
1 m = 100 cm
1 cm = 10 mm
For measuring large distances, metre
is not a convenient unit. We define a
larger unit of length. It is called
kilometre (km).
1 km = 1000 m
Now, we can repeat all our
measurement activities using a
standard scale and measure in SI units.
Before we do that, we do need to know
the correct way of measuring lengths
and distances.

10.5 CORRECT MEASUREMENT
LENGTH

OF

In our daily life we use various types of
measuring devices. We use a metre scale

Fig.10.6 A metre scale and a 15 cm scale
MOTION AND MEASUREMENT OF DISTANCES

99

for measuring length. A tailor uses a
tape, whereas a cloth merchant uses a
metre rod. For measuring the length of
an object, you must choose a suitable
device. You cannot measure the girth of
a tree or the size of your chest using a
metre scale, for instance. Measuring
tape is more suitable for this. For small
measurements, such as the length of
your pencil, you can use a 15 cm scale
from your geometry box.
In taking measurement of a length,
we need to take care of the following:
1. Place the scale in contact with the
object along its length as shown in
Fig.10.7.
2. In some scales, the ends may be
broken. You may not be able to see
the zero mark clearly (Fig.10.8 (a)].
In such cases, you should avoid

taking measurements from the zero
mark of the scale. You can use any
other full mark of the scale, say,
1.0 cm [Fig.10.8 (b)]. Then you must
subtract the reading of this mark
from the reading at the other end.
For example, in Fig.10.8 (b) the
reading at one end is 1.0 cm and
at the other end it is 14.3 cm.
Therefore, the length of the object is
(14.3-1.0) cm = 13.3 cm.

3. Correct position of the eye is also
important for taking measurement.
Your eye must be exactly in front of
the point where the measurement is
to be taken as shown in Fig.10.9.
Position 'B' is the correct position
of the eye. Note that from position
'B', the reading is 7.5 cm. From
positions 'A' and 'C', the readings
may be different.

Activity 3
Measure the height of your classmate
using hand span and then by using a
metre scale. For this, ask your classmate
to stand with his back against a wall.
Make a mark on the wall exactly above
his head. Now, measure the distance
from the floor to this mark on the wall
with your handspan and then with a
metre scale. Let all other students
measure this length in a similar way.
Record all observations in Table 10.3.
Table 10.3 Measurement of height
Who measured Height in
the height?
handspans

Height in
cm

Study carefully results obtained by
different students. The results in
column 2 may be different from each
other as the length of the handspan may
be different for different students. Look
MOTION AND MEASUREMENT OF DISTANCES

at the results in column 3 where the
measurements are done using a
standard scale. The results may be close
to each other now, but, are they exactly
equal? If not, why do you think there is
a difference? After all, everybody is using
the same scale and not different hand
spans. This could be due to small errors
in taking observations. In higher classes
we will learn about the importance of
knowing and handling such errors in
measurement.

10.6 MEASURING THE LENGTH
CURVED LINE

OF A

We cannot measure the length of a
curved line directly by using a metre
scale. We can use a thread to measure
the length of a curved line.

Activity 4
Use a thread to measure the length of
the curved line AB (Fig.10.10). Put a
knot on the thread near one of its ends.
Place this knot on the point A. Now,
place a small portion of the thread along
the line, keeping it taut using your
fingers and thumb. Hold the thread at
this end point with one hand. Using the
other hand, stretch a little more portion
of the thread along the curved line. Go

A

B

Fig.10.10 Measuring the length of a curved line
with a thread
101

on repeating this process till the other
end B of the curved line is reached.
Make a mark on the thread where it
touches the end B. Now stretch the
thread along a metre scale. Measure the
length between the knot in the beginning
and the final mark on the thread. This
gives the length of the curved line AB.
We see that we need a lot of care to
ensure that we are measuring distances
and lengths correctly. And, we need
some standard units and devices with
which we measure these distances and
can convey our results to others.

10.7 MOVING THINGS AROUND
Activity 5

US

Think of some objects you have seen
recently. List them in Table 10.4. A
school bag, a mosquito, a table, people
sitting on desks, people moving about?
May be a butterfly, dog, cow, your hand,
a small baby, a fish in water, a house, a
factory, a stone, a horse, a ball, a bat, a
moving train, a sewing machine, a wall
clock, hands of a clock? Make your list
as large as you can.
Which of these are moving? Which
are at rest?

How did you decide whether an object
is in motion or at rest?
You might have noticed that the bird
is not at the same place after some time,
while the table is at the same place. On
this basis you may have decided whether
an object is at rest or in motion.
Let us look at the motion of an ant
closely.

Activity 6
Spread a large sheet of white paper on
the ground and keep a little sugar on it.
Ants are likely to be attracted to the
sugar and you will find many ants
crawling on the sheet of paper soon. For
any one ant, try and make a small mark
with a pencil near its position when it
has just crawled on to the sheet of paper
(Fig. 10.11). Keep marking its position
after a few seconds as it moves along on
the sheet of paper. After some time,
shake the paper free of the sugar and
the ants. Connect the different points
you have marked, with arrows, to show
the direction in which the ant was

moving. Each point you have marked
shows where the ant moved to, in
intervals of a few seconds.
Motion seems to be some kind of a
change in the position of an object
with time, isn't it?
In Activity 5, where did you place
objects like a clock, a sewing machine
or an electric fan in your grouping of
objects? Are these objects moving from
one place to other? No? Do you notice
movement in any of their parts? The
blades of the fan or the hands of a
clock— how are they moving? Is their
movement similar to that of a train? Let
us now look at some types of motion to
help us understand these differences.

10.8 TYPES

OF

In all these examples we see that the
objects move along a straight line. This
type of motion is called rectilinear
motion.

Activity 7
Take a stone, tie a thread to it and whirl
it with your hand. Observe the motion
of the stone. We see that the stone moves
along a circular path.
In this motion, the distance of the
stone from your hand remains the same.
This type of motion is called circular
motion (Fig. 10.13).

MOTION

You may have observed the motion of a
vehicle on a straight road, march-past
of soldiers in a parade or the falling
of a stone (Fig. 10.12). What kind
of motion is this? Sprinters in a
100-metre race
also move along a
straight track. Can
you think of more
such examples from
your surroundings?
(a)

(c)

(b)
Fig.10.12 Some examples of rectilinear motion
MOTION AND MEASUREMENT OF DISTANCES

The motion of a point marked on the
blade of an electric fan or the hands of
a clock are examples of circular motion.
The electric fan or the clock by
themselves are not moving from one
place to another. But, the blades of the
103

fan rotate and so do
the hands of a
clock. If we mark a
point anywhere on
the blades of a fan or
on the hands of a
clock, the distance of
this point from the
centre of the fan or
the clock, will remain the same as
they rotate.
In some cases, an object repeats its
motion after some time. This type of
motion is called periodic motion. Take
the stone tied with a string that you
used in Activity 6. Now, hold the string
in your hand and let the stone hang
from it. Pull the stone to one side with
the other hand and let it go. This is a
pendulum. Something to have a lot of
fun with and something that will help
us understand about periodic motion.
Motion of a pendulum, a branch of a
tree moving to and fro, motion of a child
on a swing, strings of a guitar or the
surface of drums (tabla) being played,
are all examples of periodic motion where

Boojho is not sure why we say that
the distance of the stone from your
hand is the same when we whirl it
around. Can you help him
understand this? Remember
that the stone is held
with a string.

an object or a part of it repeats its motion
after a fixed interval of time (Fig. 10.14).
Did you observe a sewing machine
as a part of Activity 5? You must have
observed that it remains at the same
location while its wheel moves with a
circular motion. It also has a needle that
moves up and down continuously, as
long as the wheel rotates, isn't it? This
needle is undergoing a periodic motion.
Have you observed closely, the
motion of a ball on the ground? Here,
SCIENCE

the ball is rolling on the ground –
rotating as well as moving forward on
the ground. Thus, the ball undergoes a
rectilinear motion as well as rotational
motion. Can you think of other
examples where objects undergo
combinations of different types of
motion?
We did many measurement activities
and discussed some kinds of motion.
We saw that motion is a change in the
position of an object with time.

The change in this position can
be determined through distance
measurements. This allows us to know
how fast or slow a motion is. The
movement of a snail on the ground, a
butterfly flitting from flower to flower, a
river flowing along on clear rounded
pebbles, an aeroplane flying high up
in the air — making jet trails, moon
going around the Earth, blood flowing
inside our bodies, there is motion
everywhere around us!

Light, Shadows and
Reflections

W

e see so many objects around
us, colourful and different.
On the way to school we see
things like buses, cars, cycles, trees,
animals and sometimes flowers. How do
you think, we see all these objects?
Think of the same places at night
time if it were completely dark. What will
you see? Suppose you go inside a
completely dark room. Are you able to
see any objects in the room?
But, when you light a candle or a
torch you can see the objects present in
the room, isn’t it? Without light, things
cannot be seen. Light helps us see
objects.
The torch bulb is an object that gives
out light of its own. The Sun, is another
familiar object that gives its own light.
During the day, its light allows us to
see objects. Objects like the sun that
give out or emit light of their own are
called luminous objects.
What about objects like a chair, a
painting or a shoe? We see these when
light from a luminous object (like the
Sun, a torch or an electric light) falls on
these and then travels towards our eye.

11.1 T RANSPARENT , O PAQUE

all, it is an opaque object. If you are
able to see clearly through an object, it
is allowing light to pass through it and
is transparent. There are some objects
through which we can see, but not very
clearly. Such objects are known as
translucent.

Activity 1
Look around you and collect as many
objects as you can — an eraser, plastic
scale, pen, pencil, notebook, single sheet
of paper, tracing paper or a piece of
cloth. Try to look at something far away,
through each of these objects (Fig. 11.1).
Is light from a far away object able to
travel to your eye, through any of the
objects?
Record your observations in a table
as shown in Table 11.1.
We see that a given object or material
could be transparent, translucent or

light to pass through it completely,

11.2 WHAT EXACTLY

ARE

SHADOWS?

Activity 2
Now, one by one hold each of the opaque
objects in the sunlight, slightly above
the ground. What do you see on the
ground? You know that the dark patch
formed by each on the ground is due
to its shadow. Sometimes you can
identify the object by looking at its
shadow (Fig. 11.2).
Spread a sheet of paper on the
ground. Hold a familiar opaque object
at some height, so that its shadow is
formed on the sheet of paper on the
ground. Ask one of your friends to draw

Fig. 11.2 Sometimes shadow of an object gives
an idea about its shape
108

the outline of the shadow while you are
holding the object. Draw outlines of the
shadows of other objects in a similar
way.
Now, ask some other friends to
identify the objects from these outlines
of shadows. How many objects are they
able to identify correctly?
Do you observe your shadow in a
dark room or at night when there is no
light? Do you observe a shadow when
there is just a source of light and
nothing else, in a room? It seems we
need a source of light and an opaque
object, to see a shadow. Is there anything
else required?

Activity 3
This is an activity that you will have to
do in the dark. In the evening, go out in
an open ground with a few friends. Take
a torch and a large sheet of cardboard
with you. Hold the torch close to the
ground and shine it upwards so that its
light falls on your friend's face. You now
have a source of light that is falling on
an opaque object. If there were no trees,
building or any other object behind your
friend, would you see the shadow of
your friend's head? This does not mean
SCIENCE

Fig. 11.3 A shadow is obtained only on a
screen

that there is no shadow. After all, the
light from the torch is not able to pass
through his body to the other side.
Now, ask another friend to hold the
cardboard sheet behind your friend. Is
the shadow now seen on the cardboard
sheet (Fig. 11.3)?
Thus, the shadow can be seen only
on a screen. The ground, walls of a room,

Fig 11.4 Shadows of animals hidden in your hand
LIGHT, SHADOWS AND REFLECTIONS

a building, or other such surfaces act
as a screen for the shadows you observe
in everyday life.
Shadows give us some information
about shapes of objects. Sometimes,
shadows can also mislead us about the
shape of the object. In Fig. 11.4 are a few
shadows that we can create with our
hands and make-believe that they are
shadows of different animals. Have fun!

Activity 4
Place a chair in the school ground on a
sunny day. What do you observe from
the shadow of the chair?
Does the shadow give an accurate
picture of the shape of the chair? If the
chair is turned around a little, how does
the shape of the shadow change?
Take a thin notebook and look at its
shadow. Then, take a rectangular box
and look at its shadow. Do the two
shadows seem to have a similar shape?
Take flowers or other objects of
different colours and look at their
shadows. A red rose and a yellow rose,
for instance. Do the shadows look
different in colour, when the colours of
the objects are different?
Take a long box and look at its
shadow on the ground. When you move
the box around, you may see that the
size of the shadow changes. When is the
shadow of the box the shortest, when
the long side of the box is pointed
towards the Sun or when the short side
is pointing towards the Sun?
Let us use this long box, to prepare
a simple camera.
109

11.3 A PINHOLE CAMERA
Surely we need a lot of complicated stuff
to make a camera? Not really. If we just
wish to make a simple pin hole camera.

Activity 5
Take two boxes so that one can slide
into another with no gap in between
them. Cut open one side of each box.
On the opposite face of the larger box,
make a small hole in the middle
[Fig. 11.5 (a)]. In the smaller box, cut
out from the middle a square with a side
of about 5 to 6 cm. Cover this open
square in the box with tracing paper
(translucent screen) [Fig. 11.5 (b)]. Slide
the smaller box inside the larger one
with the hole, in such a way that the
side with the tracing paper is inside
[Fig. 11.5 (c)]. Your pin hole camera is
ready for use.
Holding the pin hole camera look
through the open face of the smaller

cloth to cover your head and the pinhole
camera. Now, try to look at some distant
objects like a tree or a building through
the pinhole camera. Make sure that the

pinhole camera are in bright sun shine.
Move the smaller box forward or
backward till you get a picture on the

Are these pin hole images different
from their shadows?
Look through your pin hole camera
at the vehicles and people moving on
the road in bright sun light.
Do the pictures seen in the camera
show the colours of the objects on the
other side? Are the images erect or
upside down? Surprise, surprise!
Let us now image the Sun, with our
pin hole camera. We need a slightly
different set up for this. We just need a
large sheet of cardboard with a small
pin hole in the middle. Hold the sheet
up in the Sun and let its shadow fall on
a clear area. Do you see a small circular
image of the Sun in the middle of the
shadow of the cardboard sheet?

Sun when an eclipse is visible from your

of the Sun's image gradually becoming
darker as the eclipse starts. Never ever
look directly at the Sun. That could
be extremely harmful for the eyes.
There is an interesting pin hole
camera in Nature. Sometimes, when we
pass under a tree covered with large
number of leaves, we notice small
patches of sun light under it (Fig. 11.6).
These circular images are, in fact, pin
hole images of the Sun. The gaps
between the leaves, act as the pin holes.
These gaps are all kinds of irregular
shapes, but, we can see circular images

the pipe a little while you are looking at
the candle [Fig. 11.7 (b)]. Is the candle
visible now? Turn the pipe a little to your
right or left. Can you see the candle now?
What do you conclude from this?
This suggests that light travels along
a straight line, isn’t it? That is why,
when opaque objects obstruct it, a
shadow forms.

REFLECTIONS

We all use mirrors at home. You look into
the mirror and see your own face inside
the mirror. What you see is a reflection
of your face in the mirror. We also see
reflections of other objects that are in
front of the mirror. Sometimes, we see
reflections of trees, buildings and other
objects in the water of a pond or a lake.

the patch of light falls on another friend
standing in the room.
This activity suggests that a mirror
changes the direction of light that falls
on it.
Here is an activity that shows light
travelling along straight lines and
getting reflected from a mirror.

Activity 7

Activity 8

This activity should be done at night or
in a dark room. Ask one of your friends
to hold a mirror in his/her hand at one
corner of the room. Stand at another
corner with a torch in your hand. Cover
the glass of torch with your fingers and
switch it on. Adjust your fingers with a
small gap between them so that you can
get a beam of light. Direct the beam of
the torch light onto the mirror that your
friend is holding. Do you see a patch of
light on the other side (Fig. 11.8)? Now,

Fix a comb on one side of a large thermo
Col sheet and fix a mirror on the other
side as shown in Fig. 11.9. Spread a
dark coloured sheet of paper between
the mirror and the comb. Keep this in
sunlight or send a beam of light from a
torch through the comb.
What do you observe? Do you get
a pattern similar to that shown
in Fig. 11.9?
This activity gives us an idea of the
manner in which light travels and gets
reflected from a mirror.

THINGS TO THINK ABOUT
1.

Opaque objects cast shadows, isn't it? Now, if we hold a transparent object in
the Sun, do we see anything on the ground that gives us a hint that we are
holding something in our hand?

2.

We saw that changing colour of opaque objects does not change the colour of
their shadows. What happens if we place an opaque object in coloured light?
You can cover the face of a torch with a coloured transparent paper to do this.
(Did you ever noticed the colours of evening shadows just as the Sun is setting?)

THINGS TO READ
Rudyard Kipling's "Just So Stories" and in particular, the story of "How the Leopard
got its spots" where he mentions stripy, speckly, patchy-blatchy shadows. Here
are a few lines from this story, that has a lot of shadows.
...after ever so many days, they saw a great, high, tall forest full of tree trunks
all 'sclusively speckled and sprottled and spottled, dotted and splashed and
slashed and hatched and cross-hatched with shadows. (Say that quickly aloud,
and you will see how very shadowy the forest must have been.)
'What is this,' said the Leopard, 'that is so 'sclusively dark, and yet so full of
little pieces of light?'

Electricity and Circuits

W

e use electricity for many
purposes to make our tasks
easier. For example, we use
electricity to operate pumps that lift
water from wells or from ground level
to the roof top tank. What are other
purposes for which you use electricity?
List some of them in your notebook.
Does your list include the use of
electricity for lighting? Electricity
makes it possible to light our homes,
roads, offices, markets and factories
even after sunset. This helps us to
continue working at night. A power station
provides us with electricity. However, the
supply of electricity may fail or it may not
be available at some places. In such
situations, a torch is sometimes used for
providing light. A torch has a bulb that
lights up when it is switched on. Where
does the torch get electricity from?

12.1. ELECTRIC CELL
Electricity to the bulb in a torch is
provided by the electric cell. Electric cells
Caution

are also used in alarm clocks,
wristwatches, transistor radios, cameras
and many other devices. Have you ever
carefully looked at an electric cell? You
might have noticed that it has a small
metal cap on one side and a metal disc
on the other side (Fig. 12.1). Did you
notice a positive (+) sign and a negative
(–) sign marked on the electric cell? The

Fig.12.1 An Electric Cell

metal cap is the positive terminal of the
electric cell. The metal disc is the
negative terminal. All electric cells have
two terminals; a positive terminal and a
negative terminal.
An electric cell produces electricity
from the chemicals stored inside it.
When the chemicals in the electric cell
are used up, the electric cell stops

You might have seen the danger sign shown here displayed on poles,
electric substations and many other places. It is to warn people that
electricity can be dangerous if not handled properly. Carelessness in
handling electricity and electric devices can cause severe injuries and
sometimes even death. Hence, you should never attempt to experiment
with the electric wires and sockets. Also remember that the electricity
generated by portable generators is equally dangerous. Use only electric
cells for all activities related to electricity.

Filament

Caution: Never join the two terminals
of the electric cell without connecting
them through a switch and a device
like a bulb. If you do so, the chemicals
in the electric cell get used up very fast
and the cell stops working.

then has to be replaced with a new one.
A torch bulb has an outer case of
glass that is fixed on a metallic base [Fig.
12. 2 (a)]. What is inside the glass case
of the bulb?

Activity 1
Take a torch and look inside its bulb.
You can also take out the bulb with the
help of your teacher. What do you
notice? Do you find a thin wire fixed in
the middle of the glass bulb [Fig. 12.2
(b)]? Now switch the torch on and
observe which part of the bulb is
glowing.
The thin wire that gives off light is
called the filament of the bulb. The
filament is fixed to two thicker wires,
which also provide support to it, as
shown in Fig. 12.2 (b). One of these thick
wires is connected to the metal case at
the base of the bulb [Fig. 12.2 (b)]. The
other thick wire is connected to the
metal tip at the centre of the base. The
base of the bulb and the metal tip of the
base are the two terminals of the bulb.
These two terminals are fixed in such a
ELECTRICITY AND CIRCUITS

way that they do not touch each other.
The electric bulbs used at home also
have a similar design.
Thus, both the electric cell and the
bulb have two terminals each. Why do
they have these two terminals?

Let us try to make an electric bulb light
up using an electric cell. How do we do
that?

Activity 2
Take four lengths of electric wire with
differently coloured plastic coverings.
Remove a little of the plastic covering
from each length of wire at the ends.
This would expose the metal wires at
the ends of each length. Fix the exposed
parts of the wires to the cell and the
bulb as shown in Fig 12.3 and Fig. 12.4.

Fig.12.3 Electric cell with two wires attached to it
117

Fig.12.4 Bulb connected to two wires

You can stick the wires to the bulb
with the tape used by electricians. Use
rubber bands or tape to fix the wires to
the cell.
Now, connect the wires fixed to the
bulb with those attached to the cell in
six different ways as has been shown in
Fig. 12.5 (a) to (f). For each arrangement,
find out whether the bulb glows or not.

(a)

(d)

Write 'Yes' or 'No' for each arrangement
in your notebook.
Now, carefully look at the
arrangements in which the bulb glows.
Compare these with those in which the
bulb does not glow. Can you find the
reason for the difference?
Keep the tip of your pencil on the
wire near one terminal of the electric cell
for the arrangment in Fig. 12.5 (a). Move
the pencil along the wire all the way to
the bulb. Now, from the other terminal
of the bulb, move along the other wire
connected to the cell. Repeat this
exercise for all the other arrangements
in Fig. 12.5. Did the bulb glow for the
arrangements in which you could not
move the pencil from one terminal to
the other?

12.3 AN ELECTRIC CIRCUIT
In Activity 2 you connected one terminal
of the electric cell to the other terminal
through wires passing to and from the
electric bulb. Note that in the
arrangements shown in Fig. 12. 5 (a)
and (f), the two terminals of the electric
cell were connected to two terminals of
the bulb. Such an arrangement is an
example of an electric circuit. The electric
circuit provides a complete path for
electricity to pass (current to flow)
between the two terminals of the electric
cell. The bulb glows only when current
flows through the circuit.
In an electric circuit, the direction of
current is taken to be from the positive
to the negative terminal of the electric
cell as shown in Fig.12.6. When the

An electric bulb may fuse due to
many reasons. One reason for a bulb to
fuse is a break in its filament. A break
in the filament of an electric bulb means
a break in the path of the current
between the terminals of the electric cell.
Therefore, a fused bulb does not light
up as no current passes through its
filament.
Can you now explain why the bulb
did not glow when you tried to do so
with the arrangements shown in Fig.
12.5 (b), (c), (d) and (e)?
Now we know how to make a bulb
light up using an electric cell. Would
you like to make a torch for yourself?

Activity 3
Take a torch bulb and a piece of wire.
Remove the plastic covering at the two
ends of the wire as you did before. Wrap
one end of a wire around the base of an
electric bulb as shown in Fig. 12.7. Fix
the other end of the wire to the negative
terminal of an electric cell with a rubber
band. Now, bring the tip of the base of
the bulb that is, its other terminal, in
contact with the positive terminal of the

Fig.12.6 Direction of current in an electric
circuit

terminals of the bulb are connected with
that of the electric cell by wires, the
current passes through the filament of
the bulb. This makes the bulb glow.
Sometimes an electric bulb does not
glow even if it is connected to the cell.
This may happen if the bulb has fused.
Look at a fused bulb carefully. Is the
filament inside it intact?

bulb away from the terminal of the
electric cell. Does the bulb remain
lighted? Is this not similar to what you
do when you switch your torch on or
off?

12.4 ELECTRIC SWITCH
We had an arrangement for switching
on or off our home made torch by
moving the base of the bulb away from
the tip of the cell. This was a simple
switch, but, not very easy to use. We
can make another simple and easier
switch to use in our circuit.

Activity 4
You can make a switch using two
drawing pins, a safety pin (or a paper
clip), two wires and a small sheet of
thermo Col or a wooden board. Insert

Fig. 12.8 A simple switch
120

Fig 12.9 An electric circuit with a switch

Now, make a circuit by connecting
an electric cell and a bulb with this
switch as shown in Fig.12.9. Rotate the
safety pin so that its free end touches
the other drawing pin. What do you
observe? Now, move the safety pin away.
Does the bulb continue to glow?
The safety pin covered the gap
between the drawing pins when
you made it touch two of them. In
this position the switch is said to be 'on'
(Fig. 12.10). Since the material of the
safety pin allows the current to pass

Fig. 12.10 A switch in ‘on’ position
SCIENCE

through it, the circuit was complete.
Hence, the bulb glows.
On the other hand, the bulb did not
glow when the safety pin was not in
touch with the other drawing pin. The
circuit was not complete as there was a
gap between the two drawing pins. In
Boojho has drawn the inside
of the torch as in Fig. 12.11.
When we close the switch,
the circuit is completed and
the bulb glows. Can you
draw a red line on the figure
indicating the complete circuit?

this position, the switch is said to be
'off' as in Fig. 12.9.
A switch is a simple device that either
breaks the circuit or completes it. The
switches used in lighting of electric
bulbs and other devices in homes work
on the same principle although their
designs are more complex.

wires to make a circuit. Suppose we use

circuits so that the current can pass
through them? Let us find out.

Activity 5
Disconnect the switch from the electric
circuit you used for Activity 4. This would
leave you with two free ends of wires as
shown in Fig. 12.12 (a). Bring the free
ends of the two wires close, to let them
touch each other. Does the bulb light up?
You can now use this arrangement to test
whether any given material allows current
to pass through it or not.

materials such as coins, cork, rubber,
glass, keys, pins, plastic scale, wooden
block, pencil lead, aluminium foil,
candle, sewing needle, thermo Col, paper
and pencil lead. One by one bring the
free ends of the wires of your tester in
contact with two ends of the samples
you have collected [Fig. 12.12 (b)]. Make
sure that the two wires do not touch
each other while you are doing so. Does
the bulb glow in each case?
Make a table in your notebook
similar to Table.12.1, and record your
observations.

What do you find? The bulb does not
glow when the free ends of the wires are
in contact with some of the materials you
have tested. This means that these
materials do not allow the electric current
to pass through them. On the other hand,
some materials allow electric current to
pass through them, which is indicated
by the glowing bulb. Materials which
allow electric current to pass through
them are conductors of electricity.
122

Insulators do not allow electric current
to pass through them. With the help of
Table 12.1, name the materials that are
conductors of electricity and also those
which are insulators.
Conductors ______, ______, _________
Insulator _________, _______, ________
What do you conclude? Which
materials are conductors and which are
insulators? Recall the objects that we
grouped as those having lustre, in
Chapter 4. Are they the conductors? It
now seems easy to understand why
copper, aluminum and other metals are
used for making wires.
Let us recall Activity 4 in which we
made an electric circuit with a switch
(Fig.12.9). When the switch was in the
open position, were the two drawing pins
not connected with each other through
the thermo Col sheet? But, thermo Col,
you may have found is an insulator.
What about the air between the gap?
Since the bulb does not glow when there
is only air in the gap between the drawing
pins in your switch, it means that air is
also an insulator.
Conductors and insulators are
equally important for us. Switches,
electrical plugs and sockets are made of
conductors. On the other hand, rubber
and plastics are used for covering
electrical wires, plug tops, switches and
other parts of electrical appliances,
which people might touch.
Caution: Your body is a conductor of
electricity. Therefore, be careful when
you handle an electrical appliance.

apart on a wooden board so that these can be used as a hook. Fix the wire
between the nails after inserting it through the loop of the key. Connect one
end of this wire to a bulb and a cell. Connect the other terminal of the cell to
the key with a wire. Ask your friend to move the loop along the straight wire
without touching it. Glowing of the bulb would indicate that the loop of the key
has touched the wire.

How Magnets Were Discovered
It is said that, there was a shepherd
named Magnes, who lived in ancient
Greece. He used to take his herd of
sheep and goats to the nearby
mountains for grazing. He would take
a stick with him to control his herd. The
stick had a small piece of iron attached
at one end. One day he was surprised
to find that he had to pull hard to
free his stick from a rock on the

mountainside (Fig. 13.3). It seemed as
if the stick was being attracted by the
rock. The rock was a natural magnet
and it attracted the iron tip of the
shepherd's stick. It is said that this is
how natural magnets was discovered.
Such rocks were given the name
magnetite, perhaps after the name of that
shepherd. Magnetite contains iron.
Some people believe that magnetite was
first discovered at a place called
Magnesia. The substances having the
property of attracting iron are now known
as magnets. This is how the story goes.
In any case, people now have
discovered that certain rocks have the
property of attracting pieces of iron. They
also found that small pieces of these
rocks have some special properties.
They named these naturally occurring
materials magnets. Later on the process
of making magnets from pieces of iron
was discovered. These are known as
artificial magnets. Nowadays artificial
126

magnets are prepared in different
shapes. For example, bar magnet,
horse-shoe magnet, cylindrical or a ballended magnet. Fig.13.4 shows a few
such magnets.

Activity 1
Take a plastic or a paper cup. Fix it on
a stand with the help of a clamp as
shown in Fig. 13.5. Place a magnet
inside the cup and cover it with a paper
so that the magnet is not visible. Attach
a thread to a clip made of iron. Fix the
other end of the thread at the base of
the stand. (Mind you, the trick involved
here, is to keep the length of the thread
sufficiently short.) Bring the clip near
the base of the cup. The clip is raised in
air without support, like a kite.

Activity 2
Let us walk in the footsteps of Magnes.
Only, this time, we will change the
positions of the magnet and the iron.
There will be a magnet at the end of our
shepherd's stick. We can attach a small
magnet to a hockey stick, walking stick
or a cricket wicket with a tape or some
glue. Let us now go out on a "Magnes
walk" through the school playground.
What does our "Magnes stick" pick up
from the school ground? What about
objects in the classroom?
Collect various objects of day-to-day
use from your surroundings. Test these
with the "Magnes stick". You can also
take a magnet, touch these objects with
it and observe which objects stick to the
magnet. Prepare a table in your
notebook as shown in Table 13.1. and
record your observations.
Look at the last column of Table 13.1
and note the objects that are attracted
by a magnet. Now, make a list of

materials from which these objects are
made. Is there any material common in
all the objects that were attracted by
the magnet?
We understand that magnet attracts
certain materials whereas some do not
get attracted towards magnet. The
materials which get attracted towards
a magnet are magnetic – for example,
iron, nickel or cobalt. The materials
which are not attracted towards a
magnet are non-magnetic. What
materials did you find to be nonmagnetic from Table 13.1? Is soil a
magnetic or a non-magnetic material?

Boojho has this question for you.

Rub a magnet in the sand or soil. Pull
out the magnet. Are there some particles
of sand or soil sticking to the magnet?
Now, gently shake the magnet to remove
the particles of sand or soil. Are some
particles still sticking to it? These might
be small pieces of iron (iron filings)
picked up from the soil.
Through such an activity, we can
find out whether the soil or sand from a
given place contains particles that have
iron. Try this activity near your home,
school or the places you visit on your
holidays. Does the magnet with iron
filings sticking to it, look like any one
of those shown in Fig. 13.6?
Make a table of what you find.

13.3 FINDING DIRECTIONS
Magnets were known to people from
ancient times. Many properties of
magnets were also known to them. You
might have read many interesting
stories about the uses of magnets. One
such story is about an emperor in China
named Hoang Ti. It is said that he had
a chariot with a statue of a lady that
could rotate in any direction. It had an
extended arm as if it was showing the
way (Fig. 13.8). The statue had an
interesting property. It would rest in
such a position that its extended arm
always pointed towards South. By
looking at the extended arm of the
statue, the Emperor was able to locate
directions when he went to new places
on his chariot.
FUN WITH MAGNETS

Let us make such a direction finder
for ourselves.

Activity 5
Take a bar magnet. Put a mark on one
of its ends for identification. Now, tie a
thread at the middle of the magnet so
that you may suspend it from a wooden
stand (Fig. 13.9). Make sure that the
magnet can rotate freely. Let it come to
rest. Mark two points on the ground to
show the position of the ends of the
magnet when it comes to rest. Draw a

Fig. 13.9 A freely suspended bar magnet

129

line joining the two points. This line
shows the direction in which the magnet
was pointing in its position of rest. Now,
rotate the magnet by gently pushing one
end in any direction and let it come to
rest. Again, mark the position of the two
ends in its position of rest. Does the
magnet now point in a different
direction? Rotate the magnet in other
directions and note the final direction
in which it comes to rest.
Do you find that the magnet always
comes to rest in the same direction?
Now can you guess the mystery behind
the statue in the Emperor's chariot?
Repeat this activity with an iron bar
and a plastic or a wooden scale instead
of a magnet. Do not use light objects for
this activity and avoid doing it where
there are currents of air. Do the other
materials also always come to rest in the
same direction?
We find that a freely suspended bar
magnet always comes to rest in a
particular direction, which is the NorthSouth direction. Use the direction of the
rising sun in the morning to find out
the rough direction towards east, where
you are doing this experiment. If you
stand facing east, to your left will be
North. Using the Sun for finding
directions may not be very exact, but, it
will help to make out the direction
North from the South, on your line.
Using this you can figure out which end
of the magnet is pointing to the North
and which points to the South.
The end of the magnet that points
towards North is called its North seeking
130

In which direction is the main
gate of your school situated from

end or the North pole of the magnet. The
other end that points towards the South
is called South seeking end or the South
pole of the magnet. All magnets have two
poles whatever their shape may be.
Usually, north (N) and south (S) poles
are marked on the magnets.
This property of the magnet is very
useful for us. For centuries, travellers
have been making use of this property
of magnets to find directions. It is said
that in olden days, travellers used to find
directions by suspending natural
magnets with a thread, which they
always carried with them.
Later on, a device was developed
based on this property of magnets. It is
known as the compass. A compass is
usually a small box with a glass cover
on it. A magnetised needle is pivoted
inside the box, which can rotate freely
(Fig. 13.10). The compass also has a dial

Fig. 13.10 A compass
SCIENCE

with directions marked on it. The
compass is kept at the place where we
wish to know the directions. Its needle
indicates the north-south direction
when it comes to rest. The compass is
then rotated until the north and south
marked on the dial are at the two ends
of the needle. To identify the north-pole
of the magnetic needle, it is usually
painted in a different colour.

13.4 MAKE YOUR OWN MAGNET
There are several methods of making
magnets. Let us learn the simplest one.
Take a rectangular piece of iron. Place
it on the table. Now take a bar magnet
and place one of its poles near one edge
of the bar of iron. Without lifting the
bar magnet, move it along the length of
the iron bar till you reach the other end.
Now, lift the magnet and bring the pole
(the same pole you started with) to the
same point of the iron bar from which
you began (Fig. 13.11). Move the magnet
again along the iron bar in the same
direction as you did before. Repeat this
process about 30-40 times. Bring a pin
or some iron filings near the iron bar to
check whether it has become a magnet.
If not, continue the process for some

more time. Remember that the pole of
the magnet and the direction of its
movement should not change. You can
also use an iron nail, a needle or a blade
and convert them into a magnet.
You now know how to make a
magnet. Would you like to make your
own compass?

Activity 6
Magnetise an iron
needle using a bar
magnet. Now, insert
the
magnetised
needle through a
small piece of cork or
foam. Let the cork
float in water in a
Fig. 13.12 A
bowl or a tub. Make
compass in a cup
sure that the needle
does not touch the water (Fig. 13.12).
Your compass is now ready to work.
Make a note of the direction in which
the needle points when the cork is
floating. Rotate the cork, with the needle
fixed in it, in different directions. Note
the direction in which the needle points
when the cork begins to float again
without rotating. Does the needle always
point in the same direction, when the
cork stops rotating?

(Fig. 13.13). In car A, keep the south
pole of the magnet towards its front.
Place the magnet in opposite direction
in car B. Now, place the two cars close
to one another (Fig. 13.13). What do you
observe? Do the cars remain at their
places? Do the cars run away from each
other? Do they move towards each other
and collide? Record your observations
in a table as shown in Table 13.3. Now,
place the toy cars close to each other
such that the rear side of car A faces
the front side of car B. Do they move
as before? Note the direction in which
the cars move now. Next, place the car
A behind car B and note the direction
in which they move in each case
(Fig 13.14). Repeat the activity by
placing cars with their rear sides facing

each other. Record your observations in
each case.
What do we find from this activity?
Do two similar poles attract or repel each
other? What about opposite poles — do
they attract or repel each other?
This property of the magnets can also
be observed by suspending a magnet
and bringing one by one the poles of
another magnet near it.

the fibres that we use for making fabric
come from plants. Is water not needed
to grow these? Can you think of some
more uses of water? Water is used in
industries for producing almost all the

for producing many things.

“We get water from taps”. Have you ever
wondered where water in the taps comes
from? Water that we get from taps is also
drawn from a lake or a river or a well
(Fig. 14.2). It is then supplied through
a network of pipes.

14.3 WATER CYCLE
Disappearing Trick of Water

Fig. 14.3 Oceans cover a major part of the earth

Do you know that about two thirds
of the Earth is covered with water? Most
of this water is in oceans and seas
(Fig. 14.3).
The water in the oceans and seas has
many salts dissolved in it — the water
is saline. So, it is not fit for drinking
and other domestic, agricultural and
industrial needs. You might have heard
the famous lines of the poem “Rime of
the Ancient Mariner” written by S.T.
Coleridge in 1798:

How many times have you noticed that
water spilled on a floor dries up after
some time? The water seems to disappear.
Similarly, water disappears from wet
clothes as they dry up (Fig. 14.4). Water
from wet roads, rooftops and a few other
places also disappears after the rains.
Where does this water go?

“Water water every where
Nor any drop to drink”

Fig. 14.4 Clothes drying on a clothes-line

Here the poet has described the
plight of sailors on a ship lost in the
ocean.
Yet, oceans play an important role
in supplying the water that we use. Do
you find this surprising? After all, the
water that we use is not salty. Many of
us live in places far away from the
oceans. Does the water supply in these
places also depend on the oceans? How
does the ocean water reach ponds, lakes,
rivers and wells, which supply us water?
How come the water from these sources
is not saline anymore?

Do you remember Activity 6 in
Chapter 5 in which water with salt
dissolved in it was heated? What did we
find? The water evaporated and the salt
was left behind. This activity gives us
an idea that, on heating, water changes
into its vapour. We also realise from this
activity, that water vapour does not carry
away the salt with it. Water vapours so
formed become a part of the air and
cannot usually be seen. We also found
that heating is essential to convert water
into its vapour. However, we have seen
that water changes into its vapour also

138

SCIENCE

from the fields, roads, rooftops and
other land areas. We also discussed in
Chapter 5 that to obtain salt, water from
the sea is left in shallow pits to let the
water evaporate. From where does this
water get the heat it needs to evaporate?
Let us find out.

Activity 2
Take two similar plates. Place one of the
plates in sunlight and keep the other
under shade. Now, pour equal amount
of water in each of the plates (Fig. 14.5).
You can use a cap of a bottle to measure
water. Make sure that water does not
spill over. Observe the two plates after
every 15 minutes. Does the water seem
to disappear? From which plate does it
disappear first? What is the source of
heat for this evaporation?
During the daytime, sunlight falls on
the water in oceans, rivers, lakes and
ponds. The fields and other land areas
also receive sunlight. As a result, water
from all these places continuously
changes into vapour. However, the salts
dissolved in the water are left behind.
In Activity 2, did you find that water
also disappeared from the plate kept in

the shade, though it could have taken
more time? Does the heat from the
sunlight reach here? Yes, during the
daytime all the air surrounding us gets
heated. This warm air provides heat for
evaporation of water in the shade. Thus,
evaporation takes place from all open
surfaces of water. As a result, water
vapour gets continuously added to air.
However, evaporation of water is a slow
process. That is why we rarely notice its
loss from a bucket full of water. In
sunlight, evaporation takes place faster.
On heating water on a burner, its
evaporation takes place even faster. Is
there any other process through which
water vapour gets transferred into air?

Loss of Water by Plants
You have learnt in Chapter 7 that plants
need water to grow. Plants use a part of
this water to prepare their food and

Boojho has been reading about
transpiration. He asked himself how much water is lost through
transpiration by wheat plants
that give us one kilogram of
wheat? He found out that this is
nearly 500 litres, that is, roughly
25 large sized buckets full of
water. Can you now imagine the
amount of water lost by plants
of all the forests, crops and
grasslands together?

Fig.14.5 Evaporation of water in sunlight and in

WATER

retain some of it in their different parts.
Remaining part of this water is released
by the plants into air, as water vapour
through the process of transpiration. Do
you remember observing transpiration
of water by plants in Activity 4 in
Chapter 7?
Water vapour enters the air through
the processes of evaporation and
transpiration. Is it lost for ever? No, we
get it back again, as we will see.

Paheli has noticed dew on leaves of
grass on winter mornings. Did you
notice something similar on leaves
or metal surfaces like iron grills and
gates on a cold morning? Is this
also due to condensation? Do you
see this happening on hot
summer mornings?

How are clouds formed?
Activity 3
Take a glass half filled with water. Wipe
the glass from the outside with a clean
piece of cloth. Add some ice into the
water. Wait for one or two minutes.
Observe the changes that take place on
the outer surface of the glass (Fig.14.6).
From where do water drops appear
on the outer side of the glass? The cold
surface of the glass containing iced water,
cools the air around it, and the water
vapour of the air condenses on the
surface of the glass. We noticed this
process of condensation in Activity 7 in
Chapter 5.

Fig. 14.6 Drops of water appear on outer
surface of the glass containing water with ice
140

The process of condensation plays an
important role in bringing water back
to the surface of earth. How does it
happen? As we go higher from the
surface of the earth, it gets cooler. When
the air moves up, it gets cooler and
cooler. At sufficient heights, the air
becomes so cool that the water vapour
present in it condenses to form tiny
drops of water called droplets. It is these
tiny droplets that remain floating in air
and appear to us as clouds (Fig. 14.7).
It so happens that many droplets of
water come together to form larger sized

Fig. 14.7 Clouds
SCIENCE

Boojho has noticed fog near the
ground in winter mornings. He
wonders if this is also condensation
of water vapour near the
ground. What do you
think?

drops of water. Some drops of water
become so heavy that they begin to fall.
These falling water-drops are, what we
call rain. In special conditions, it may
also fall as hail or snow.
Thus, water in the form of vapour
goes into air by evaporation and
transpiration, forms clouds, and then
comes back to the ground as rain, hail
or snow.

14.4 BACK

TO THE

OCEANS

What happens to the water that rain and
snow bring to different regions of earth?
Almost all land surfaces are above the
level of oceans. Most of the water that
falls on the land as rain and snow
sooner or later goes back to the oceans.
This happens in many ways.
Snow in the mountains melts into
water. This water flows down the
mountains in the form of streams and
rivers (Fig. 14.8). Some of the water that
falls on land as rain, also flows in the
form of rivers and streams. Most of the
rivers cover long distances on land and
ultimately fall into a sea or an ocean.
However, water of some rivers flows
into lakes.
WATER

Fig. 14.8 Rain water flows down in the form of
streams and rivers

The rainwater also fills up the lakes
and ponds. A part of the rainwater gets
absorbed by the ground and seems to
disappear in the soil. Some of this water
is brought back to the air by the process
of evaporation and transpiration. The
rest seeps into the ground. Most of this
water becomes available to us as ground
water. Open wells are fed by ground
water. Ground water is the source for
many lakes as well. It is also this ground
water which is drawn by a handpump
or a tubewell. The more handpumps or
tubewells that are used in an area, the
deeper we need to dig to find this ground
water. The loss in the level of ground
water due to over use, is worrisome.
Paheli wants to share a concern with
you. In those areas where the land has
little or no vegetation, the rainwater flows
away quickly. Flowing rainwater also
takes the top layer of the soil away with
it. There are few areas where most of the
land is covered with concrete. This
reduces the seepage of rainwater into the
ground which ultimately affects the
availability of ground water.
141

We now know that water brought
back to the surface of the earth by rain,
hail or snow, goes back to oceans. Thus,
water from the ocean and surface of the
earth goes into air as vapour; returns
as rain, hail or snow and finally goes
back to the oceans. The circulation of
water in this manner is known as the
water cycle (Fig.14.9). This circulation
of water between ocean and land is a
continuous process. This maintains the
supply of water on land.

14.5 WHAT

IF IT

RAINS HEAVILY?

The time, duration and the amount of
rainfall varies from place to place. In
some parts of the world it rains
throughout the year while there are
places where it rains only for a few days.

Fig. 14.10 A scene after heavy rains

In our country, most of the rainfall
occurs during the monsoon season.
Rains bring relief especially after hot
summer days. The sowing of many crops
depends on the arrival of monsoon.
However, excess of rainfall may lead
to many problems (Fig. 14.10). Heavy

Fig. 14.9 Water cycle
142

SCIENCE

Fig. 14.11 A scene of a flooded area

rains may lead to rise in the level of water
in rivers, lakes and ponds. The water
may then spread over large areas causing
floods. The crop fields, forests, villages,
and cities may get submerged by water
(Fig. 14.11). In our country, floods cause
extensive damage to crops, domestic
animals, property and human life.
During floods, the animals living in
the water also get carried away with the
waters. They often get trapped on land
areas and die when floodwater recedes.
Rains also affect the animals living in
the soil.

14.6 WHAT HAPPENS IF IT DOES NOT
RAIN FOR A LONG PERIOD?
Can you imagine what would happen if
it does not rain in a region for a year or
more? The soil continues to lose water
by evaporation and transpiration. Since
it is not being brought back by rain,
the soil becomes dry. The level of water
in ponds and wells of the region goes
down and some of them may even dry
up. The ground water may also become
scarce. This may lead to drought.
In drought conditions, it is difficult
to get food and fodder. You might have
WATER

heard about droughts occurring in some
parts of our country or the world. Are
you aware of the difficulties faced by
the people living in these areas? What
happens to the animals and the
vegetation in these conditions? Try and
find out about this by talking to your
parents and neighbours and by
reading about it from newspapers
and magazines.

14.7 HOW CAN WE CONSERVE WATER?
Only a small fraction of water available
on the Earth is fit for use of plants,
animals and humans. Most of the water
is in the oceans and it cannot be used
directly. When the level of the ground
water decreases drastically, this can not
be used any more. The total amount of
water on Earth remains the same, but,
the water available for use is very limited
and is decreasing with over usage.
The demand for water is increasing
day-by-day. The number of people using
water is increasing with rising
population. In many cities, long queues
for collection of water are a common site
(Fig. 14.12). Also, more and more water
is being used for producing food and by
the industries. These factors are leading

Fig. 14.12 A queue for collecting water
143

to shortage of water in many parts of
the world. Hence, it is very important
that water is used carefully. We should
take care not to waste water.

14.8 RAINWATER HARVESTING
One way of increasing the availability
of water is to collect rainwater and store
it for later use. Collecting rainwater in
this way is called rainwater harvesting.
The basic idea behind rainwater
harvesting is “Catch water where it falls”.
What happens to the rainwater that
falls in places that are mostly covered
with concrete roads and buildings? It
flows into the drains, isn't it? From there
water goes to rivers or lakes, which could
be far away. A lot of effort will then be
required to get this water back into our
homes as the water did not seep into
the ground.
Discussed here are two techniques
of rainwater harvesting:
1. Rooftop rainwater harvesting: In this
system the rainwater is collected from

144

Fig. 14.13 Rooftop rainwater harvesting

the rooftop to a storage tank, through
pipes. This water may contain soil
from the roof and need filtering
before it is used. Instead of collecting
rainwater in the tank, the pipes
can go directly into a pit in the
ground. This then seeps into the
soil to recharge or refill the ground
water (Fig. 14.13).
2. Another option is to allow water
to go into the ground directly
from the roadside drains that
collect rainwater.

Water is essential for life.
Water vapour gets added to air by evaporation and transpiration.
The water vapour in the air condenses to form tiny droplets of water, which
appear as clouds. Many tiny water droplets come together and fall down as
rain, snow or hail.
Rain, hail and snow replenish water in rivers, lakes, ponds, wells and soil.
The circulation of water between ocean and land is known as the
water cycle.
Excessive rains may cause floods while lack of it for long periods may
cause droughts.
The amount of usable water on earth is limited so it needs to be used
carefully.

Air Around us

W

e have learnt in Chapter 9 that
all living things require air.
But, have you ever seen air?
You might not have seen air, but, surely
you must have felt its presence in so
many ways. You notice it when the
leaves of the trees rustle or the clothes
hanging on a clothes-line sway. Pages
of an open book begin fluttering
when the fan is switched on. The moving
air makes it possible for you to fly your
kite. Do you remember Activity 3 in
Chapter 5 in which you separated the
sand and sawdust by winnowing?
Winnowing is more effective in moving
air. You may have noticed that during
storms the wind blows at a very high
speed. It may even uproot trees and blow
off the rooftops.
Have you ever played with a firki
(Fig. 15.1)?

Hold the stick of the firki and place it
in different directions in an open area.

Take an empty glass bottle. Is it really
empty or does it have something inside?
Turn it, upside down. Is something
inside it, now?

Fig. 15.4 Experiments with an empty bottle.

Now, dip the open mouth of the bottle
into the bucket filled with water as
shown in Fig. 15.4. Observe the bottle.
Does water enter the bottle? Now tilt the
bottle slightly. Does the water now enter
the bottle? Do you see bubbles coming
out of the bottle or hear any bubbly
sound? Can you now guess what was
in the bottle?
Yes! You are right. It is “air”, that was
present in the bottle. The bottle was not
empty at all. In fact, it was filled
completely with air even when you
turned it upside down. That is why you
notice that water does not enter the
bottle when it is in an inverted position,
as there was no space for air to escape.
When the bottle was tilted, the air was
able to come out in the form of bubbles,
and water filled up the empty space that
the air has occupied.
This activity shows that air occupies
space. It fills all the space in the bottle.
It is present everywhere around us. Air
has no colour and one can see through
it. It is transparent.
Our earth is surrounded by a thin
layer of air. This layer extends up to
many kilometres above the surface of
the earth and is called atmosphere.

15.2 WHAT

IS

AIR MADE

UP OF?

Until the eighteenth century, people
thought that air was just one substance.
Experiments have proved that it is really
not so. Air is a mixture of many gases.
What kind of a mixture is it? Let us find
out about some of the major
components of this mixture, one by one.

Water vapour
We have learnt earlier that air contains
water vapour. We also saw that, when
air comes in contact with a cool surface,
it condenses and drops of water appear
on the cooled surfaces. The presence of
water vapour in air is important for the
water cycle in nature.

Oxygen
Activity 3
In the presence of your teacher, fix two
small candles of the same size in the
middle of two shallow containers. Now,
fill the containers with some water. Light
the candles and then cover each one of
them with an inverted glass (one much

component in the air, which does not
support burning. The major part of air
(which does not support burning candle)
is nitrogen. It takes up nearly four-fifth
of the space that air fills.

Carbon dioxide
Fig. 15.6 Air has oxygen

taller than the other) as shown in Fig.
15.6. Observe carefully what happens to
the burning candles and the water level.
Do the candles continue to burn or
go off? Does the level of water inside
glasses remain the same?
The burning of the candle must be
due to presence of some component of
air, isn’t it? Do you find any difference
in your observation with the two glasses
of different heights? What can be the
reason for this?
Burning can occur only in the
presence of oxygen. We see that, one
component of air is oxygen. Now, the
amount of air and hence its oxygen
component inside each glass in our
experiment, is limited. When most of
this oxygen is used up by the burning
candle, it can no longer burn and blows
out. Also, some of the space occupied
by the oxygen inside the glass becomes
empty and the water rises up to fill or
occupy this space.

Nitrogen
In Activity 3 did you observe that a
major part of air is still present in the
glass bottle even after the candle blew
out? This indicates the presence of some
AIR AROUND US

In a closed room, if there is some
material that is burning, you may
have felt suffocation. This is due to
excess of carbon dioxide that may be
accumulating in the room, as the
burning continues. Carbon dioxide
makes up a small component of the air
around us. Plants and animals consume
oxygen for respiration and produce
carbon dioxide. Plant and animal matter
on burning, also consumes oxygen and
produces mainly carbon dioxide and a
few other gases.

Dust and smoke
The burning of fuel also produces
smoke. Smoke contains a few gases and
fine dust particles and is often harmful.
That is why you see long chimneys in
factories. This takes the harmful smoke
and gases away from our noses, but,
brings it closer to the birds flying up in
the sky!
Dust particles are always present
in air.

Activity 4
Find a sunny room in your school/
home. Close all the doors and windows
with curtains pulled down to make the
room dark. Now, open the door or a
window facing the sun, just a little, in
such a way that it allows sunlight to

crossing often wear a mask

enter the room only through a slit.
Look carefully at the incoming beam
of sunlight.
Do you see some tiny shining
particles moving in the beam of sunlight
(Fig. 15.7)? What are these particles?
During cold winters you might have
observed similar beam of sunlight filter
through the trees in which dust particles
appear to dance merrily around!
This shows that air also contains
dust particles. The presence of dust
particles in air varies from time to time,
and from place to place.
We inhale air when we breathe
through our nostrils. Fine hair and
mucus are present inside the nose to
prevent dust particles from getting into
the respiratory system.

Do you recall being scolded by your
parents when you breathe through your
mouth? If you do that, harmful dust
particles may enter your body.
We may conclude, then, that air
contains some gases, water vapour and
dust particles. The gases in air are
mainly nitrogen, oxygen, small amount
of carbon dioxide, and many other
gases. However, there may be some
variations in the composition of air from
place to place. We see that air contains

mostly nitrogen and oxygen. In fact,
these two gases together make up 99%
of the air. The r emaining 1% is
constituted by carbon dioxide and a few
other gases, water vapour and dust
particles (Fig. 15.9).

Well before the water begins to boil, look

Here is a question from Paheli, “Will
the tiny air bubbles seen before the
water actually boils, also appear if
we do this activity by reheating
boiled water kept in an air tight
bottle?” If you do not know
the answer you may try doing
it and see for yourself.

vessel. Do you see tiny bubbles on the
inside (Fig. 15.10)?
These bubbles come from the air
dissolved in water. When you heat the
water, to begin with, the air dissolved in
it escapes. As you continue heating, the
water itself turns into vapour and finally
begins to boil. We learnt in Chapters 8
and 9, that the animals living in water
use the dissolved oxygen in water.
The organisms that live in soil also
need oxygen to respire, isn’t it? How do
they get the air they need, for
respiration?

Activity 6
Take a lump of dry soil in a beaker or a
glass. Add water to it and note what
happens (Fig. 15.11). Do you see
bubbles coming out from soil? These
bubbles indicate the presence of air in
the soil.
When the water is poured on the
lump of soil, it displaces the air which
is seen in the form of bubbles. The
organisms that live inside the soil and
the plant roots respire in this air. A lot
151

Fig. 15.11 Soil has air in it

of burrows and holes are formed in deep
soil by the animals living in the soil.
These burrows also make spaces
available for air to move in and out of
the soil. However, when it rains heavily,
water fills up all the spaces occupied by
the air in the soil. In this situation,
animals living in the soil have to come
out for respiration. Could this be the
reason why earthworms come out of the
soil, only during heavy rains?
Have you ever wondered why all the
oxygen of atmosphere does not get used
up though a large number of organisms
are consuming it? Who is refilling the
oxygen in the atmosphere?

15.4 HOW IS THE OXYGEN IN THE
ATMOSPHERE REPLACED?
In Chapter 7, we read about
photosynthesis. In this process, plants
make their own food and oxygen is
produced along with it. Plants also
consume oxygen for respiration, but
they produce more of it than they
consume. That is why we say plants
produce oxygen.
It is obvious that animals cannot live
without plants. Similarly, plants can not
152

survive for long without animals. They
would consume all the carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere. We can see that both
need each other, as the balance of
oxygen and carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere is thus maintained. This
shows the interdependence of plants
and animals.
We can now appreciate, how important
air is for life on earth. Are there any other
uses of air? Have you heard about a
windmill? Look at Fig. 15.12.

Fig. 15.12 A windmill

The wind makes the windmill
rotate. The windmill is used to draw
water from tubewells and to run flour
mills. Windmills are also used to
generate electricity. Air helps in the
movements of sailing yachts, gliders,
parachutes and aeroplanes. Birds,
bats and insects can fly due to the
presence of air. Air also helps in the
dispersal of seeds and pollen of
flowers of several plants. Air plays an
important role in water cycle.

Garbage in, Garbage out

W

e throw out so much rubbish
or garbage everyday from our
homes, schools, shops and
offices. The grains, pulses, biscuits, milk
or oil purchased in shops, are packed
in plastic bags or tins. All these
wrapping material go out as garbage.
We sometimes buy things that are
rarely used and often thrown into
the garbage.
We generate so much garbage in our
day-to-day activities! We often throw
groundnut shells on public places, in
buses or trains, after eating the nuts.
We throw away the ticket when we get
off a bus. A child might go on
sharpening pencils just for fun. If we
make mistakes or spill ink on our
notebook, we tear off the sheet and
throw it away. And we also throw away
many domestic wastes such as broken
toys, old clothes, shoes and slippers.
What if the garbage is not removed
from our homes and surroundings? How
do you think, this will harm us? When
safai karamcharis take the garbage from
the bins, where does the garbage go and
what happens to it? Is it possible for all
of this garbage to be changed into
something that will not harm us? Can
we contribute towards this in any way?
We will look for answers to these
questions, in this chapter.

Children from Paheli and Boojho’s
school did a project called ‘Dealing with
Garbage’. We will learn about some of
the things they learnt through this
project.

16.1 DEALING

WITH

GARBAGE

Safai karamcharis collect the garbage in
trucks and take it to a low lying open
area, called a landfill (Fig. 16.1).
There the part of the garbage that
can be reused is separated out from the
one that cannot be used as such. Thus,

Fig. 16.1 A landfill

the garbage has both useful and nonuseful components. The non-useful
component is separated out. It is then
spread over the landfill and then
covered with a layer of soil. Once the
landfill is completely full, it is usually
converted into a park or a play ground.
For the next 20 years or so, no building
is constructed on it. To deal with
some of the useful components of
garbage, compost making areas are
developed near the landfill. What is
compost? Let us learn about it, from the
following activity.

Paheli did wonder as to what
could be useful garbage? Why
was it thrown away in the first
place? Is there some garbage that
is not actually garbage?

Activity 1
Collect the garbage from your house
before it is thrown into the dustbin.
Separate it into two groups, so that
they have:
Group 1: Garbage from the kitchen —
like fruit and vegetable peels, egg shells,
waste food, tea leaves. Include
newspapers, dry leaves and paper bags
in this group.
Group 2: Pieces of cloth, polythene
bags, broken glass, aluminium wrappers,
nails, old shoes and broken toys.
Now divide the contents of each group
into two separate heaps. Label them
156

Fig. 16.2 Putting garbage heaps in pits

as A, B, C and D. Put one heap from
Group 1 and one heap from Group 2
into two separate plastic bags. Tie the
mouth of these two bags tightly. Put all
the four heaps in separate pits and
cover them with soil (Fig. 16.2). You
can also use four pots to bury these
garbage heaps.
Remove the soil after four days and
observe the changes in the garbage. A
black colour and no foul smell indicates
that rotting of garbage is complete. Put
the heaps again in the pits and cover
with the soil. Observe again after every
two days and note your observations as
suggested. Did the garbage.
(i) rot completely and not smell?
(ii) rot only partially?
(iii) rot almost completely, but still
smells bad?
(iv) not change at all?
Garbage in which heap was seen to
rot and which did not?
Enter options (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) in
the columns of Table 16.1 based on your

observations. If you make any other
observations, do not forget to write all
these down in your notebook. Do not
remove and burn the garbage that did
not rot.
If the garbage was found to rot
completely and did not smell, mix it in
the soil where you sow your favourite
plants. This would provide nutrients to
the plants.
You must have observed from this
activity that some things in the garbage
rot. They form manure which is used
for the plants. The rotting and
conversion of some materials into
manure is called ‘composting’.
In some cities and towns
muncipalities provide separate dustbins
for collecting two kinds of garbage.
Usually one is coloured blue and the
other green. The blue bin is for materials
that can be used again — such as
plastics, metals and glass. Did you
notice that these are the materials that
do not rot in the garbage heaps? The
green bins are for collecting kitchen and
other plant or animal wastes. You may
have noticed that this type of wastes rot
completely when buried in the soil. Do

Have you noticed garbage
heaps of dried leaves on the
roadside? Most of the time
these are burnt (Fig. 16.3).
Farmers too often burn the
husk, dried leaves and part of
crop plants in their fields after
harvesting. Burning of these, produces
smoke and gases that are harmful to
our health. We should try to stop such
practices. These wastes could be
converted into useful compost.

Fig. 16.3 Burning of leaves produce harmful
gases

Here are some of the observations
and thoughts, noted by Paheli and
Boojho, from their project “Dealing
with Garbage”.
Boojho noted in his notebook: Do
not burn leaves! You will not be
able to tolerate the fumes!

157

Paheli made a note in her
notebook: Why has the
government not made
burning of leaves a theft?
Not theft really ☺. She must have
meant “illegal”. She wanted that the
government should make a law against
the burning of leaves and other plant
wastes anywhere in India.

16.2 VERMICOMPOSTING
We can be friends of plants by supplying
them with compost. We will also be very
good friends to ourselves by making
compost.
Talking of friends, do you know that
earthworms are called farmer’s friend?
Let us find out how a type of earthworm
called redworm is used for composting.
This method of preparing compost
with the help of redworms is called
vermicomposting. We can try to make
manure by vermicomposting at school.

One can also use green leaves, pieces
of dried stalks of plants, husk or pieces
of newspaper or carboard to spread over
the layer of sand. However, shiny or
plastic coated paper should not be used
for this purpose. Dried animal dung
could also be used as a spread over sand
or wire mesh.
Sprinkle some water to make this
layer wet. Take care not to use excess of
water. Do not press the layer of waste.
Keep this layer loose so that it has
sufficient air and moisture.
Now, your pit is ready to welcome the
redworms. Buy some redworms and put
them in your pit (Fig. 16.4). Cover them
loosely with a gunny bag or an old sheet
of cloth or a layer of grass.

Activity 2
Let us dig a pit (about 30 cm deep) or
keep a wooden box at a place, which is
neither too hot nor too cold. What about
a place which does not get direct
sunlight? Let us now make a
comfortable home for our redworms in
the pit or the box.
Spread a net or chicken mesh at the
bottom of the pit or the box. You can
also spread 1 or 2 cm thick layer of sand
as an alternative. Now, spread some
158

Your redworms need food. You can give
them vegetable and fruit wastes, coffee
and tea remains and weeds from the
fields or garden (Fig. 16.5). It might be
a good idea to bury this food about
2-3 cm inside the pit. Do not use wastes
SCIENCE

Fig. 16.5 Food for redworms

that may contain salt, pickles, oil,
vinegar, meat and milk preparations as
food for your redworms. If you put these
things in the pit, disease-causing small
organisms start growing in the pit. Once
in a few days, gently mix and move the
top layers of your pit.
Redworms do not have teeth. They
have a structure called ‘gizzard’, which
helps them in grinding their food.
Powdered egg shells or sea shells could
be mixed with the wastes. This would
help redworms in grinding their food. A
redworm can eat food equal to its own
weight, in a day.
Redworms do not survive in very hot
or very cold surroundings. They also
need moisture around them. If you take
good care of your worms, in a month’s
time their number will double.
Observe the contents of the pit
carefully after 3-4 weeks. Do you now
see loose, soil-like material in the pit?
Your vermicompost is ready (Fig. 16.6).
Put some wastes as food in one corner
of the pit. Most of the worms will shift
GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT

Fig. 16.6 Vermicomposting

towards this part of the pit, vacating the
other part. Remove the compost from
the vacated part and dry it in the sun
for a few hours. Your vermicompost is
ready for use!
The part left in the pit has most of
the worms in it. You can use these for
preparing more compost or share them
with another user.
Use this excellent vermicompost in
your pots, gardens or fields. Is this not
like getting the ‘best out of waste’? Those
of you who have agricultural fields can
try vermicomposting in large pits. You
can save a lot of money that is spent on
buying expensive chemical fertilizers
and manure from the market.

16.3 THINK

AND

THROW

How much of garbage do you think, is
thrown out by each house everyday? You
can make an estimate by using a bucket
as a measure. Use a 5-10 litre bucket to
collect the garbage from your home for
159

Fig. 16.7 Neighbourhood garbage dump

a few days. In how many days does the
bucket become full? You know the
number of members in your family. If
you find out the population of your city
or town, can you now estimate the
number of buckets of garbage that may
be generated in a day in your city or
town? We are generating mountains of
garbage everyday, isn’t it (Fig. 16.7)?
Let us read a story about a village
where there is less garbage and more
wisdom. Nanu studies in Class VI. He is
very fond of making paper planes. His
mother is very annoyed when he tears
off sheets from new notebooks to make
aeroplanes, but Nanu does not care.
Once Nanu went to his aunt’s village,
along with his mother. He was amazed
at the variety of things his cousin Shyam
had made. Files from old charts,
greeting cards decorated with flowers
made from pencil shavings, mats from
old clothes, baskets from used old
polythene bags were some of the items
Nanu liked. Shyam had even made a
diary from invitation cards!
160

One morning Nanu went looking for
his grandmother (Nani). He saw that she
was applying a thick paste on a basket.
Nanu asked, “Nani, What are you doing?
What is this paste?”
“This is papier-mâchè, a paste made
of clay and paper in which I have also
mixed some rice husk”, replied Nani.
“But, why are you putting it on the
basket?”, asked Nanu.
“To make it stronger”, said Nani and
added “would you like to learn this from
me?” Nanu was not very keen and ran
outside to play. He was only interested
in tearing up papers to make planes. In
fact he also started tearing up papers
from Shyam’s files!
Shyam collected all the pieces of
paper Nanu had used, wondering what
to do about him! He just did not listen
to anyone!
It was Nanu’s birthday in a few days.
Shyam planned to invite Nanu’s friends.
Nanu took out money from his mud pot
and went to the market. He bought some
paper hats for his friends. He asked the
shopkeeper for a polythene bag to keep
the hats, who gave him a paper bag
instead of polythene. Nanu also bought
many other items like biscuits and
toffees. He found it difficult to carry all
of these things as no shopkeeper was
ready to give a polythene bag. Shyam
had told him to carry a cloth bag with
him and he was sorry he did not listen
to him. Somehow, he managed to reach
home with all his purchases (Fig. 16.8).
Nanu’s friends enjoyed the feast on
his birthday and played many games.
SCIENCE

Fig. 16.8 Nanu with bags full of purchases

All his friends wore the shiny paper hats
Nanu had bought!
Shyam had made beautiful papiermâchè masks for Nanu’s friends. He had
a special gift for Nanu as well. A
photoframe and a greeting card made
from the paste of all the pieces of paper
Nanu had thrown away! It was a new
experience for Nanu. All his friends went
home with their masks. Nanu was too
excited to finish his meal and look at
his gifts.
Nanu returned home, after his
holidays were over. How different his
town was from Shyam’s village! There
were no rag pickers in the village as it
was neat and clean. But now he stopped
making faces when he saw the rag
picking children near his house.
You might have seen some children,
sorting the garbage near your house or
at other places. Observe the children at
work and find out how they separate
usefull material from the garbage. They
are actually helping us.
GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT

Talk to one such child and find out:
What do they do with the rubbish
they collect? Where do they take it?
Does he/she go to school? What
about his/her friends?
If they do not go to school, find out
the possible reasons.
Can you help this child to read and
write?
Have you ever helped at home to sell
old newspapers, glass and metal
things, plastic bags and your old
notebooks to a garbage dealer? Talk to
him and find out what he does with all
the garbage.
Would you like to make paper from
old and discarded paper like Shyam?
Let us learn to do this.

16.4 RECYCLING

OF

PAPER

You will require pieces of old newspapers,
magazines, used envelopes, notebooks,
or any other paper. Do not use shiny,
plastic coated paper. You will also need
a frame fitted with a wire mesh or a net.
You can also use a large sized sieve in
place of a frame.
Tear the paper into small pieces. Put
them in a tub or a bucket and pour water
in it. Let the pieces of paper remain
submerged in water for a day. Make a
thick paste of paper by pounding it.
Now, spread the wet paste on the wire
mesh fixed to the frame. Pat it gently to
make the thickness of layer of the paste
as uniform as possible. Wait till water
drains off. If required spread an old cloth
or a sheet of newspaper on the paste to
let it soak up the extra water.
161

Now, carefully remove the layer of
paste from the frame, spread it on a sheet
of newspaper in the sun. Keep the
corners of the newspaper sheet pressed
by putting some weights so that these
do not curl up.
You can add food colour, pieces of
dry leaves or flower petals or pieces of
coloured paper in the paste before
spreading it. It would help you to get a
recycled paper with beautiful patterns
on it.
Can we recycle everything, just as we
recycle paper?

16.5 PLASTICS – BOON

OR A

CURSE?

Some kind of plastics can be recycled,
but, not all of them. Did you notice
that polythene bags and some plastics
did not rot in Activity 1? You might now
easily understand why polythene bags
create a big problem in garbage disposal.
It may be a little difficult to imagine
our life without plastics. Shall we list a
few things we use that are made of
plastics? Toys, shoes, bags, pens,
combs, tooth brushes, buckets, bottles,
and water pipes — the list is very long.
Can you name a few parts of a bus, car,
radio, television, refrigerator and a
scooter that are made of plastics?
The use of plastics in itself might not
create so much of a problem. Problems
arise when we use plastics excessively
and are ignorant about ways of
disposing their waste. This is what is
happening all around us! We might even
be acting irresponsibly, knowing well
about its harmful effects.
162

We often use plactic bags to store
cooked food items. Sometimes these bags
may not be suitable for keeping eatables.
Consuming food packed in such plastic
bags could be harmful to our health.
Many a time shopkeepers use plastic
bags that have been used earlier for
some other purpose. Sometimes bags
collected by rag pickers are also used
after washing them. Use of such recycled
plastic bags to keep food items could be
harmfull for our health. For storing
eatables we must insist on use of plastic
bags that are approved for such a use.
All kind of plastics give out harmful
gases, upon heating or burning. These
gases may cause many health problems,
including cancer, in humans. The
government has also laid down
guidelines for recycling of plastics.

Paheli would like to suggest that
containers used for storing
poisonous substances should
be recycled separately and that
such recycled plastics
are not used to make
plastic bags.
You must have noticed that people
often fill garbage in plastic bags and
then throw it away. When stray animals
look for food in these bags, they end up
swallowing these. Sometimes, they die
due to this.
The plastic bags thrown away
carelessly on roads and other places get
into drains and the sewer system. As a
SCIENCE

result, drains get choked and the water
spills on the roads. During heavy rains,
it might even create a flood like situation.
There is a lot of harm that too much use
of plastics can do!
What can we do to minimise over use
of plastics and deal with garbage?
1. We make a minimum use of plastic
bags. We re-use the bags whenever it
is possible to do so without any
adverse affects.
2. We insist shopkeepers use paper
bags. We carry a cloth or a jute bag
when we go out for shopping.
3. We do not use plastic bags to store
eatables.
4. We do not throw plastic bags here
and there, after use.

5. We never burn plastic bags and other
plastic items.
6. We do not put garbage in plastic bags
and throw it away.
7. We use vermicomposting at home and
deal with our kitchen waste usefully.
8. We recycle paper.
9. We use both sides of the paper to
write. We use a slate for rough work.
We use blank sheets of paper left in
our notebooks for rough work.
10.We make our family, friends and
others to follow proper practices for
disposing different kinds of wastes.
The most important point to know
and think about is that — more garbage
we generate, more difficult it will be to
get rid of it.

Waste
Garbage
Landfill
Compost
Ver micomposting
Recycling

Landfill is an area where the garbage collected from a city or town is
dumped. The area is later converted into a park.
Converting plant and animal waste including that from kitchen, into
manure, is called composting.
GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT

163

The method of making compost from kitchen garbage using redworms is
called vermicomposting.
Paper can be recycled to get useful products.
Plastics cannot be converted into less harmful substances by the process
of composting.
We need to generate less waste and find ways of dealing with the increasing
amount of garbage in our surroundings.

1.

(a) Which kind of garbage is not converted into compost by the redworms?
(b) Have you seen any other organism besides redworms, in your pit? If yes, try
to find out their names. Draw pictures of these.

2.

Discuss :
(a) Is garbage disposal the responsibility only of the government?
(b) Is it possible to reduce the problems relating to disposal of garbage?

3.

(a) What do you do with the left over food at home?
(b) If you and your friends are given the choice of eating in a plastic plate or a
banana leaf platter at a party, which one would you prefer and why?

4.

(a) Collect pieces of different kinds of paper. Find out which of these can be
recycled.
(b) With the help of a lens look at the pieces of paper you collected for the above
question. Do you see any difference in the material of recycled paper and a
new sheet of paper ?

5.

(a) Collect different kinds of packaging material. What was the purpose for which
each one was used? Discuss in groups.
(b) Give an example in which packaging could have been reduced?
(c) Write a story on how packaging increases the amount of garbage.

6.

Do you think it is better to use compost instead of chemical fertilisers? Why?

ACTIVITIES FOR DEALING WITH GARBAGE

164

1.

Collect old and discarded objects and material like glass bottles, plastic bottles,
coconut husk, wool, bed sheets, greeting cards and any other thing. Can you
make something useful out of these, instead of throwing them? Try.

2.

Prepare a detailed project report on compost making activity you did in school.

SCIENCE

A MATTER OF CONCERN!
In autumn lots of leaves are burnt in cities like Delhi. Some of the gases produced
by burning leaves are similar to the gases released by the vehicles moving on
the roads.
Instead of burning, if we make compost from these leaves, we can reduce the
use of chemical fertilizers.
The green areas which should have fresh air, actually become full of harmful
gases due to burning of leaves.
If you find any one is burning the leaves bring it to notice of municipal authorities
or write to newspapers about it.
Generate social pressure against burning of leaves. Ensure that fallen leaves
are not burnt but used for making compost.
Write to the ‘Tree Authority’ of your city or state to declare burning of leaves as
an offence.
