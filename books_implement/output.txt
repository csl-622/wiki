A wider meaning of "fabric, structure" is found in classical Latin, but not in Greek usage.

James Watt patented his parallel motion linkage in 1782, which made the double acting steam engine practical.
[13] The Boulton and Watt steam engine and later designs powered steam locomotives, steam ships, and factories.
The Industrial Revolution was a period from 1750 to 1850 where changes in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, transportation, and technology had a profound effect on the social, economic and cultural conditions of the times.
Wedge (hand axe):  Perhaps the first example of a device designed to manage power is the hand axe, also see biface and Olorgesailie.
Lever: The lever is another important and simple device for managing power.
The fulcrum of a lever is modeled as a hinged or revolute joint.
The German mechanician Franz Reuleaux[21] wrote, "a machine is a combination of resistant bodies so arranged that by their means the mechanical forces of nature can be compelled to do work accompanied by certain determinate motion."
Motors: Electric motors use either AC or DC electric current to generate rotational movement.
Illustrations by the renaissance scientist Georgius Agricola show gear trains with cylindrical teeth.
A spherical mechanism  is a mechanical system in which the bodies move in a way that the trajectories of points in the system lie on concentric spheres.
A spatial mechanism  is a mechanical system that has at least one body that moves in a way that its point trajectories are general space curves.
The rotational axes of hinged joints that connect the bodies in the system form lines in space that do not intersect and have distinct common normals.
His Difference engine can be considered an advanced mechanical calculator and his Analytical Engine a forerunner of the modern computer, though none were built in Babbage's lifetime.
Models used to study modern computers are termed State machine and Turing machine.
This acts as the molecular drive that causes muscle contraction.
Similarly the biological molecule kinesin has two sections that alternately engage and disengage with microtubules causing the molecule to move along the microtubule and transport vesicles within the cell.
Researchers have used DNA to construct nano-dimensioned four-bar linkages.
Devices that cause speed changes or changes to or from reciprocating to rotary motion, using means such as gears, pulleys or sheaves and belts, shafts, cams and cranks, usually are considered machines.

Usher[31] reports that Hero of Alexandria's treatise on Mechanics focussed on the study of lifting heavy weights.
