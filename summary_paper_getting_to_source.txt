		Summarization of the Paper related to getting to source:

Wikipedia's core consent policy is that is works towards "verifiability not truth" which claims that whatever is reflected and shown on the wikipedia is only what reliable sources beleive to be true rather than beleifs of individual wikipedians. Wiki follows "Neutral point of View Policy". According to wiki, if no reliable third party source is available on the topic then there should be no article on that topic on wiki. To decide which sources are more reliable , there is wiki's core content policy which states that academic and peer reviewed publications are usually more reliable sources such as in history, science and medicine. In addition self published sources are considered unreliable. So this paper present the idea and detailed research on What type of sources are most common and Which sources are most valued?
