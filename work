Two ways to proceed furthur....
either by creating web application : in this we can direct use the api and get the wiki data and using html process the data to be represented as a video.
or else we can create a software in pyhton using qt where we can first invoke the code of wiki data extraction and then video creation.

The main task here we have after extraction is that we are thinking of adding music behind the frames of video.
The selection and adjustment of pitch is important here.


--------------------------------------------
The part of the project which converts the text into video is been completed now we will proceed by operating it on the wiki data.
