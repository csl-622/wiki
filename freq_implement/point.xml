----

In [[navigation]], especially at [[sea]], a '''point''' is defined as one eighth of a right angle, and therefore equals exactly 11.25 degrees.  For example, a bearing of northwest by north differs by one point from a northwest bearing, and by a point from a north-northwest one.

----

In [[typography]], a '''point''' is approximately 1/72 [[inch]]; on computer displays it is often the height of one or four [[pixel]]s.

----

In [[sport]]s and [[game]]s, a '''point''' is a unit of [[scoring]].

----

A '''point''' on a [[railroad]] is also called a [[railroad switch]].
