A machine (or mechanical device) is a mechanical structure that uses power to apply forces and control movement to perform an intended action.
Simple machines are elementary examples of kinematic chains or linkages that are used to model mechanical systems ranging from the steam engine to robot manipulators.
A wedge is a simple machine that transforms lateral force and movement of the tool into a transverse splitting force and movement of the workpiece.
Today mechanics refers to the mathematical analysis of the forces and movement of a mechanical system, and consists of the study of the kinematics and dynamics of these systems.
The mechanism of a mechanical system is assembled from components called machine elements.
McCarthy and Soh describe a machine as a system that "generally consists of a power source and a mechanism for the controlled use of this power."
The idea that a machine can be decomposed into simple movable elements led Archimedes to define the lever, pulley and screw as simple machines.
Fluid Power: Hydraulic and pneumatic systems use electrically driven pumps to drive water or air respectively into cylinders to power linear movement.
The idea of a simple machine originated with the Greek philosopher Archimedes around the 3rd century BC, who studied the Archimedean simple machines: lever, pulley, and screw.
They can also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical systems.
A mechanical system manages power to accomplish a task that involves forces and movement.
Modern machines are complex systems that consist of structural elements, mechanisms and control components and include interfaces for convenient use.
The elementary mechanical components of a machine are termed machine elements.
A spherical mechanism is a mechanical system in which the bodies move in a way that the trajectories of points in the system lie on concentric spheres.
Power flow through a machine provides a way to understand the performance of devices ranging from levers and gear trains to automobiles and robotic systems.
The classification of simple machines to provide a strategy for the design of new machines was developed by Franz Reuleaux, who collected and studied over 800 elementary machines.
Later Greek philosophers defined the classic five simple machines (excluding the inclined plane) and were able to roughly calculate their mechanical advantage.
A spatial mechanism is a mechanical system that has at least one body that moves in a way that its point trajectories are general space curves.
The assumption that the system is an assembly of rigid components allows rotational and translational movement to be modeled mathematically as Euclidean, or rigid, transformations.
The modern approach to characterizing machines focusses on the components that allow movement, known as joints.
In 1586 Flemish engineer Simon Stevin derived the mechanical advantage of the inclined plane, and it was included with the other simple machines.
Electric servomotors are the actuators for mechanical systems ranging from robotic systems to modern aircraft.
This realization shows that it is the joints, or the connections that provide movement, that are the primary elements of a machine.
The dynamic analysis of a machine requires the determination of the movement, or kinematics, of its component parts, known as kinematic analysis.
The formulation and solution of rigid body dynamics is an important tool in the computer simulation of mechanical systems.
His Difference engine can be considered an advanced mechanical calculator and his Analytical Engine a forerunner of the modern computer, though none were built in Babbage's lifetime.
The dynamics of a rigid body system is defined by its equations of motion, which are derived using either Newtons laws of motion or Lagrangian mechanics.
This can be seen in Watt's steam engine (see the illustration) in which the power is provided by steam expanding to drive the piston.
10â€“75 AD) in his work Mechanics lists five mechanisms that can "set a load in motion"; lever, windlass, pulley, wedge, and screw, and describes their fabrication and uses.
An automobile engine is called an internal combustion engine because it burns fuel (an exothermic chemical reaction) inside a cylinder and uses the expanding gases to drive a piston.
A steam engine uses heat to boil water contained in a pressure vessel; the expanding steam drives a piston or a turbine.
Power plant: The heat from coal and natural gas combustion in a boiler generates steam that drives a steam turbine to rotate an electric generator.
The rigid-body dynamics studies the movement of systems of interconnected bodies under the action of external forces.
Models used to study modern computers are termed State machine and Turing machine.
The shape, texture and color of covers provide a styling and operational interface between the mechanical system and its users.
Machine design refers to the procedures and techniques used to address the three phases of a machine's lifecycle:
A number of machine elements provide important structural functions such as the frame, bearings, splines, spring and seals.
A nuclear power plant uses heat from a nuclear reactor to generate steam and electric power.
These elements provide structure for the system and control its movement.
The rotational axes of hinged joints that connect the bodies in the system form lines in space that do not intersect and have distinct common normals.
Wedge (hand axe): Perhaps the first example of a device designed to manage power is the hand axe, also see biface and Olorgesailie.
The driving link is called the cam (also see cam shaft) and the link that is driven through the direct contact of their surfaces is called the follower.
This electricity in turn is used to drive motors forming the actuators of mechanical systems.
The rotational axes of hinged joints that connect the bodies in the system are perpendicular to this ground plane.
Lever: The lever is another important and simple device for managing power.
Generally, the links are the structural elements and the joints allow movement.
This amplification, or mechanical advantage is the ratio of the input speed to output speed.
The assemblies that control movement are also called "mechanisms."
The Boulton and Watt steam engine and later designs powered steam locomotives, steam ships, and factories.
The solution of these equations of motion defines how the configuration of the system of rigid bodies changes as a function of time.
